# Performance Testing Log

## Test #0: BASELINE (BEFORE all changes)
**File**: `performance-922.png`
- **Scripting**: 8,502ms
- **INP**: 165ms
- **Status**: CRITICAL performance issues
- **Date**: Initial test

---

## Test #1: First Optimization Attempt (FAILED)
**File**: `performance-952.png`
- **Scripting**: 8,478ms (-24ms, ~0% improvement)
- **INP**: 332ms (+167ms, **101% WORSE**)
- **Status**: FAILED - Made performance worse
- **Changes Applied**:
  - CanvasShape memoization with complex comparison function
  - Cursor/CursorLayer memoization
  - useCursors debouncing (50ms)
  - Selection syncing throttling (250ms)
  - CURSOR_UPDATE_INTERVAL increased to 50ms

**Analysis**: Complex memo comparison functions too expensive

---

## Test #2: Memoization + Shape Metadata Caching
**File**: `performance-1003.png`
- **Scripting**: 16,142ms over 18s (~897ms/sec)
- **INP**: 259ms
- **Status**: SLIGHTLY WORSE than baseline
- **Changes Applied**:
  - Basic memo() on CanvasShape, Cursor, CursorLayer
  - useMemo for cursor filtering
  - useMemo for sortedShapesWithMetadata in Canvas

**Analysis**: Helped a bit but handlers still recreating, breaking memo

---

## Test #3: Custom Memo Comparisons (DISASTER)
**File**: `performance-1016.png`
- **Scripting**: 9,502ms over 19s (~500ms/sec)
- **INP**: 2518ms (**10X WORSE!** üíÄ)
- **Frame times**: 1,067ms
- **Status**: CATASTROPHIC FAILURE
- **Changes Applied**:
  - Custom arePropsEqual functions on CanvasShape
  - Custom arePropsEqual on Cursor
  - Custom arePropsEqual on CursorLayer

**Analysis**: Custom comparison functions added massive overhead! Comparing 20+ props on every render for 100s of shapes = disaster. Also partially broke by leaving userSelections in CanvasContext.

---

## Test #4: UserSelections Context Separation
**File**: `performance-1025.png` (same as 1016, incomplete refactor)
- **INP**: 2518ms (still terrible)
- **Status**: INCOMPLETE - Did not finish wiring up new context
- **Changes Attempted**:
  - Created UserSelectionsContext.tsx
  - Partially removed userSelections from CanvasContext
  - Did NOT wire up in App.tsx

**Analysis**: Left code in broken/incomplete state, which is why performance stayed terrible.

---

## Test #5: ATTEMPT 1 - Complete Refactor ‚úÖ
**File**: `performance-1040.png`
- **Scripting**: 13,739ms over 18s (~763ms/sec)
- **INP**: 611ms 
- **Status**: **SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT** from disaster, but still 3X worse than baseline
- **Changes Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ Removed ALL custom comparison functions (back to default memo)
  - ‚úÖ Completed UserSelectionsContext separation
  - ‚úÖ Wired up UserSelectionsProvider in App.tsx
  - ‚úÖ userSelections no longer in CanvasContext dependency array
  - ‚úÖ Kept useMemo for shape metadata caching
  - ‚úÖ Kept useMemo for cursor filtering

**Results Comparison**:
- From baseline (197ms) ‚Üí 611ms = **3X worse** ‚ùå
- From disaster (2518ms) ‚Üí 611ms = **4X better** ‚úÖ
- Yellow wall has gaps now (less continuous rendering)
- More balanced rendering vs scripting

**Analysis**: 
- **Good**: Separating UserSelectionsContext worked - stopped Context avalanche
- **Good**: Removing custom comparisons removed overhead
- **Bad**: Still 3X worse than baseline
- **Bad**: Still has continuous re-rendering sections
- **Root cause**: Context architecture still fundamentally wrong for collaborative real-time updates

---

## Key Learnings

1. ‚ùå **Custom memo comparisons are expensive** - Comparing 20+ props on 100s of shapes adds massive overhead
2. ‚úÖ **Separating high-frequency updates works** - UserSelectionsContext isolation helped significantly
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **React Context is not ideal for real-time collaboration** - Even with optimizations, Context re-renders are problematic
4. ‚úÖ **Default memo() is better than custom** - React's shallow comparison is highly optimized
5. ‚úÖ **useMemo for expensive computations works** - Shape metadata caching reduced work
6. üìä **Test incrementally** - One change at a time reveals what actually helps

## Next Steps (Attempt 2 - If Needed)

**Option A: Accept Current State**
- 611ms INP is usable (< 1 second)
- App is functional, just not as fast as baseline
- Stop here

**Option B: Nuclear Option - Zustand Migration**
- Replace React Context with Zustand store
- Selective subscriptions prevent re-render cascades
- Should get back to < 200ms INP
- More invasive (~500 lines changed)

**Recommendation**: If performance must match baseline, proceed with Zustand. If 611ms is acceptable, stop here.

## Timeline

- **Test #0-1**: Initial attempts, failed
- **Test #2**: Added memoization, slight improvement
- **Test #3**: Custom comparisons, catastrophic
- **Test #4**: Incomplete refactor, stayed broken
- **Test #5**: Complete refactor, significant recovery
- **Status**: Waiting for decision on Attempt 2
