# Advanced AI Tools Implementation Checklist

## Overview
**PR #2B: Advanced AI Tools + Layout Commands + Auto-Grouping**  
**Timeline:** 25 minutes  
**Complexity:** Medium-High (6 new tools, complex prompt with multi-step examples, layout logic, semantic grouping)

---

## üéØ NEW FEATURE: Auto-Grouping for Semantic UI Patterns

### What Changed?
The AI now automatically groups elements when creating **semantic UI patterns** (forms, grids, buttons, etc.) so they act as a single unit. This means users can say "create a login form" and then "move it to the right" - the entire form moves together.

### Auto-Grouping Rules

**SEMANTIC PATTERNS** (auto-group with descriptive names):
- ‚úÖ Forms: "create a login form", "create a signup form"
- ‚úÖ Grids: "make a 3x3 grid of red squares"
- ‚úÖ UI Components: "create a button with text on it", "create a navigation bar"
- ‚úÖ Structured Layouts: dashboards, panels, cards, headers

**NON-SEMANTIC PATTERNS** (do NOT auto-group):
- ‚ùå "create 3 circles and 2 rectangles" - no semantic meaning
- ‚ùå "add 5 red squares" - just quantity, no structure
- ‚ùå "make some blue shapes" - too vague

### Implementation Changes
1. **System Prompt Updated** (`aiPrompts.ts`):
   - Added AUTO-GROUPING RULE section with clear examples
   - Updated all multi-element examples to include grouping with descriptive names
   - Distinguished between semantic and non-semantic patterns

2. **Success Messages Enhanced** (`aiService.ts`):
   - Detects grouped creations: `"‚úì Created Login Form (6 elements grouped)"`
   - Shows group names: `"‚úì Grouped shapes as 'Login Form'"`
   - Returns group metadata for better messaging

3. **Input Box Styling**:
   - White rectangles (`#ffffff`) with black borders (1px stroke)
   - Labels positioned above inputs
   - Forms are properly structured and visually distinct

### Example Usage
```javascript
// User types: "create a login form"
// AI automatically:
// 1. Creates 6 elements (labels, inputs, button, text)
// 2. Positions them vertically with proper spacing
// 3. Groups them all as "Login Form"
// 4. Returns: "‚úì Created Login Form (6 elements grouped)"

// User then types: "move it to the right"
// AI recognizes "it" = "Login Form" group
// All 6 elements move together as one unit
```

## Performance Targets (Must Pass)
- [ ] Simple layout command (3-5 shapes): <2s
- [ ] Complex command (login form): <5s
- [ ] Layout with 10 shapes: <3s
- [ ] Grid creation (9 shapes): <6s
- [ ] Works with 20+ shapes on canvas

---

## Context Awareness Tests (Must Pass)
- [ ] AI identifies "these shapes" from context
- [ ] AI finds shapes by color for grouping
- [ ] AI handles "them", "it", "that" references
- [ ] AI calls `getCanvasState()` before advanced operations
- [ ] AI identifies recently created shapes correctly

---

## Common Issues & Debugging Checklist

### Issue 1: arrangeShapesInRow doesn't space correctly
- [ ] Check `arrangeInRow()` calculates width correctly
- [ ] Verify: `shape.width || (shape.radius ? shape.radius * 2 : 100)`
- [ ] Test with different shape types (rectangles, circles, triangles)

### Issue 2: Login form elements misaligned
- [ ] Verify x,y coordinates in LOGIN FORM example
- [ ] Check vertical layout positioning
- [ ] Ensure proper spacing between elements

### Issue 3: Grid doesn't form proper 3x3
- [ ] Check grid example spacing = 110px (80 + 30)
- [ ] Verify positions increment correctly
- [ ] Test with different shape sizes

### Issue 4: groupShapes fails
- [ ] Verify `canvasService.groupShapes()` method exists
- [ ] Check Phase 2 manual grouping feature is implemented
- [ ] Test with different shape combinations

### Issue 5: AI doesn't identify "these shapes"
- [ ] Review SHAPE IDENTIFICATION section in prompt
- [ ] Ensure "recently created" logic is clear
- [ ] Test context identification with multiple shapes

### Issue 6: Firestore import errors in arrangeInRow
- [ ] Change to static imports at top of file
- [ ] Add: `import { doc, getDoc, writeBatch, serverTimestamp } from 'firebase/firestore';`
- [ ] Add: `import { firestore } from '../config/firebase';`

---

- [x] 5 tool definitions added to `getToolDefinitions()`
- [x] System prompt expanded with complex examples
- [x] `generateSuccessMessage()` handles all advanced tools
- [x] Firestore imports correct (static or dynamic)

### Core Testing (Must Pass)
- [ ] **arrangeShapesInRow works (CRITICAL)**
- [ ] groupShapes works (by color, by context)
- [ ] alignShapes works (all 6 alignment types)
- [ ] bringToFront works
- [ ] addComment works

### Complex Testing (Must Pass)
- [ ] Login form creates 6 elements correctly
- [ ] 3x3 grid creates 9 shapes in pattern
- [ ] Create + arrange + group workflow works
- [ ] Layout command with 5+ shapes works
- [ ] All 17 test commands pass

### Performance (Must Pass)
- [ ] Layout command (5 shapes) <2s
- [ ] Login form <5s
- [ ] 3x3 grid <6s

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **Layout command is MANDATORY** - `arrangeShapesInRow` is required for rubric scoring, test this thoroughly
2. **Complex commands are high-value** - Login form and grid demonstrate AI's power
3. **Context awareness critical** - "these shapes" must identify recently created shapes
4. **Multi-step execution** - AI must chain operations correctly
5. **Test spacing calculation** - Layout command must handle different shape widths (rectangles vs circles)

---

## Time Estimates

- [ ] Add `arrangeInRow()` helper: 8 min
- [ ] Add 5 tool cases: 7 min
- [ ] Add 5 tool definitions: 7 min
- [ ] Expand system prompt with complex examples: 12 min
- [ ] Testing (17 commands): 20 min
- [ ] Bug fixes: 6 min

**Total: ~25 minutes** (60 min with comprehensive testing)

---

## Next Steps After Completion

- [ ] Mark PR #2B complete
- [ ] Prepare for PR #3 (Chat UI integration)
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Update implementation notes
