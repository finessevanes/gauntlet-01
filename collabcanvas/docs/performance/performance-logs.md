# Performance Logs

This file tracks performance measurements and benchmarks over time.

## Setup Complete (2025-10-19)

### Performance Monitoring System Implemented

A comprehensive performance monitoring system has been added to the CollabCanvas application:

**Components:**
- ✅ Performance Monitor Utility (`performanceMonitor.ts`)
- ✅ React Hooks (`usePerformanceMonitor.ts`)
- ✅ User-Facing Performance Panel (`PerformancePanel.tsx`)
- ✅ Unit Tests (`performanceMonitor.test.ts`)
- ✅ Integration Tests (`canvas-performance.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Documentation (PERFORMANCE_MONITORING.md, EXAMPLES.md)

**Key Measurements:**
- `shapes-sort`: Time to sort shapes by zIndex
- `shapes-render`: Time to render all shape components
- `comments-map-build`: Time to build comment metadata map

**Dev Tools Features:**
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Auto-refresh every second
- Export to CSV
- Statistics dashboard (avg, min, max, latest)
- Color-coded performance indicators
- Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`

### Baseline Measurements

Initial performance targets have been set:

| Operation           | Shape Count | Target    | Maximum   |
|--------------------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| shapes-sort        | 100         | < 1ms     | 5ms       |
| shapes-render      | 100         | < 25ms    | 50ms      |
| comments-map-build | 100         | < 5ms     | 10ms      |

### Testing

Performance test suite created with:
- Sorting benchmarks (10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 shapes)
- Rendering benchmarks (10, 50, 100, 500 shapes)
- Stress test (2000+ shapes)
- Regression detection
- Memory efficiency tests

All tests passing with expected performance characteristics.

## Example Log Entry

```
## 2025-10-20 - Optimized Shape Rendering

**What Changed:**
- Implemented React.memo for CanvasShape component
- Added useMemo for expensive calculations

**Performance Impact:**
- shapes-render (100): 25.3ms → 18.7ms (-26%)
- shapes-render (500): 110.5ms → 85.2ms (-23%)

**Notes:**
- Significant improvement in re-render performance
- No regressions detected in other measurements
- Memory usage stable
```
