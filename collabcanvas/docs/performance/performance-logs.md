# Performance Logs

This file tracks performance measurements and benchmarks over time.

## Setup Complete (2025-10-19)

### Performance Monitoring System Implemented

A comprehensive performance monitoring system has been added to the CollabCanvas application:

**Components:**
- âœ… Performance Monitor Utility (`performanceMonitor.ts`)
- âœ… Performance Requirements Tracker (`performanceRequirements.ts`)
- âœ… React Hooks (`usePerformanceMonitor.ts`)
- âœ… User-Facing Performance Panel (`PerformancePanel.tsx`)
- âœ… Unit Tests (`performanceMonitor.test.ts`)
- âœ… Integration Tests (`canvas-performance.test.tsx`)

**Dev Tools Features:**
- Real-time FPS monitoring with LIVE indicator
- Performance requirements dashboard (5 key metrics)
- Auto-refresh every second
- Export to CSV
- Statistics dashboard (avg, min, max, latest)
- Color-coded status indicators (âœ“ MET, âš  WARNING, âœ— FAILING)
- Windows 95-style retro UI
- Toggle recording on/off
- FPS history graph (last 15 seconds)
- Non-blocking overlay panel

### Performance Requirements

The system tracks 5 key performance requirements:

| Requirement      | Target       | Warning Threshold | Status Colors |
|------------------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Frame Rate       | 60 FPS       | < 55 FPS          | ðŸŸ¢ ðŸŸ¡ ðŸ”´      |
| Object Sync      | < 100ms      | < 150ms           | âœ“ âš  âœ—         |
| Cursor Sync      | < 50ms       | < 75ms            | âœ“ âš  âœ—         |
| Object Capacity  | 500+ objects | > 750 objects     | âœ“ âš  âœ—         |
| User Capacity    | 5+ users     | > 8 users         | âœ“ âš  âœ—         |

### Testing

Performance test suite created with:
- Sorting benchmarks (10, 50, 100, 500, 1000 shapes)
- Rendering benchmarks (10, 50, 100, 500 shapes)
- Comment map building tests
- Bounding box computation tests
- Filtering operations tests
- Stress test (2000+ shapes)
- Regression detection
- Memory efficiency tests

All tests passing with expected performance characteristics.

## Example Log Entry

```
## 2025-10-20 - Optimized Shape Rendering

**What Changed:**
- Implemented React.memo for CanvasShape component
- Added useMemo for expensive calculations

**Performance Impact:**
- shapes-render (100): 25.3ms â†’ 18.7ms (-26%)
- shapes-render (500): 110.5ms â†’ 85.2ms (-23%)

**Notes:**
- Significant improvement in re-render performance
- No regressions detected in other measurements
- Memory usage stable
```
