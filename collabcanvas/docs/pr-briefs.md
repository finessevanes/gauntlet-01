## Notes for Agents Creating PRDs

When creating a detailed PRD from these briefs using `docs/prd-template.md`:

1. Reference the full feature context in `docs/prd-full-features.md`
2. Follow the existing codebase patterns (see Canvas.tsx, CanvasContext.tsx)
3. All new shapes must sync in real-time (<100ms)
4. All drawing must be 60 FPS smooth
5. Use Konva.js for canvas rendering
6. Store all shapes in Firestore `canvases/main/shapes/` collection
7. AI service calls should be deterministic and testable
8. Include comprehensive test scenarios (manual + automated)
9. Payment flows should use Stripe test mode first
10. All emails should be templated and branded
