Great! If you already have `testAI("prompt")` working from the console, then you've completed the backend API integration. Let me update the PRD to reflect this:

# Simplified Chat Canvas ‚Äî Product Requirements

**Tagline:** Real-time collaborative canvas with AI chat assistant

**Business Model:** Free (no monetization)

**Status:** In Development (8-hour sprint)

---

## üéØ What It Is

A collaborative MS Paint-style canvas with a working AI chat interface. Users can draw with friends in real-time and interact with an AI assistant. Focus: **performance and functionality**.

---

## üë§ User Flow

1. **Sign up** ‚Üí Create account
2. **Select** ‚Üí Create a new canvas or pick up from a past one
3. **Draw** ‚Üí Use Paint tools on canvas
4. **Collaborate** ‚Üí Share link, friends edit in real-time
5. **Chat with AI** ‚Üí Ask questions, get help, request drawings

---

## üìê Technical Specs

- **Canvas:** Standard web canvas size
- **AI Chat:** OpenAI/Anthropic API integration with persistent chat history
- **AI Backend:** Already functional - `testAI("prompt")` works from console
- **Performance:** Optimized real-time sync, debounced updates, lazy loading

---

## üé® Design Notes

**AI Chat Interface:** Microsoft Word Office Assistant Clippy vibes
- Reference image: `collabcanvas/docs/images/clippy.jpg`
- Speech bubble style messages (not flat modern chat)
- Playful, friendly tone in AI responses
- Small Clippy icon/avatar next to AI messages
- Yellow/white color scheme reminiscent of the original
- User/AI message distinction
- Typing indicators
- Message history

## üìä Database Schema

```typescript
// users collection (SIMPLIFIED)
{
  id: string,
  email: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
}

// canvases collection (SIMPLIFIED)
{
  id: string,
  userId: string, // owner
  name: string,
  shareLink: string,
  collaborators: [userId],
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
}

// chatMessages collection (NEW)
{
  id: string,
  canvasId: string, // link chat to canvas
  userId: string,
  role: 'user' | 'assistant',
  content: string,
  createdAt: Timestamp,
}
```

## üöÄ 8-Hour Implementation Plan (REVISED)

### Hour 1-2: Performance Fixes (CRITICAL - DO FIRST)
**Goal: Stabilize existing features before adding new ones**
1. Implement debouncing on canvas updates (500ms delay)
2. Batch Firestore writes (bulk updates)
3. Add connection status indicator
4. Optimize shape rendering
5. Test with multiple users
6. Reduce real-time listener frequency

### Hour 2-3: Canvas Management
**Goal: Allow users to create/select canvases**
1. Create canvas gallery/list view
2. Add "New Canvas" button
3. Implement canvas selection
4. Add canvas naming
5. Add delete canvas functionality

### Hour 3-5: AI Chat UI (CORE FEATURE)
**Goal: Build Clippy-style chat interface and connect to existing testAI()**
1. Create chat panel component (side/bottom)
2. Design speech bubble messages
3. Add Clippy icon/avatar
4. Implement message input field
5. Style user vs AI messages
6. Wire input to `testAI()` function

- **Page load:** < 2s initial render
- **Firestore reads:** < 50 per session
- **Firestore writes:** Batched, debounced (max 2 writes/second)
- **Real-time listeners:** Throttled to 500ms intervals

---

## üé® Clippy UI Specifications

**Visual Style:**
- Speech bubble containers (rounded, with tail pointing to Clippy)
- Clippy avatar: Small icon (32x32px) next to AI messages
- Color scheme: Yellow (#FFFF99) background for AI bubbles, white for user
- Border: 1-2px solid black (retro Windows style)
- Font: System font, clean and readable

**Interaction:**

- Error state: Clippy looking confused with error message
- Empty state: Clippy greeting message on first load

**Tone:**
- Friendly, helpful, slightly playful
- Avoid overly formal language
- Use encouraging phrases ("Great question!", "Let me help with that!")

---

## üîå AI Integration Details

**Existing Implementation:**
- `testAI("prompt")` function available in browser console
- Backend API already configured and working
- Returns AI responses successfully

**What's Needed:**
1. Connect UI input field to `testAI()` function
2. Display responses in chat UI
3. Save messages to Firestore for persistence
4. Load historical messages on canvas open

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Constraints

- **Time:** 8 hours total (effectively 6 hours due to existing AI backend)
- **Scope:** AI chat UI + performance + canvas management only
- **No monetization:** Remove all payment logic
- **No postcard features:** Remove all mailing logic
- **Keep existing:** Don't break working collaboration features
- **Performance first:** Must stabilize before adding AI UI

---

## üö® Critical Path Dependencies

1. **Performance fixes MUST be completed first** - unstable base will break under AI load
2. **Canvas management before chat** - users need to select a canvas to chat about
3. **Chat UI connects to existing testAI()** - backend already done, just need frontend
4. **Testing throughout** - don't wait until Hour 8 to discover blockers
