# PRD: Spray Paint Tool â€” End-to-End Delivery

**Feature**: Spray Paint Tool for Particle-Based Effects

**Version**: 1.0

**Status**: Ready for Development

**Agent**: Delilah

**Target Release**: Phase 1 - Core Drawing Tools

**Links**: [Action Plan: pr-2-todo.md], [Test Plan: integration tests], [Tracking Issue: PR #2]

---

## 1. Summary

Users can create geometric shapes and free-form paths, but cannot create soft, textured effects like clouds, textures, or airbrushed looks. The Spray Paint Tool will enable users to click and drag to spray particles in a circular area, creating natural-looking clouds, grass, shadows, and artistic effects on postcards.

---

## 2. Problem & Goals

**Problem:** 
Users have hard-edged drawing tools (rectangles, circles, pencil) but cannot create soft, natural-looking effects like clouds, grass, or airbrushed textures that are essential for artistic postcards.

**Why now?** 
- This is PR #2 in the core feature set, building on PR #1's foundation
- Required for creating realistic postcard scenes (clouds, trees, grass)
- Essential for AI drawing features (PR #5) to create natural effects
- Completes the core Paint toolset alongside pencil and fill bucket

**Goals (ordered, measurable):**
  - [x] G1 â€” Users can spray particles in a circular area with configurable radius
  - [x] G2 â€” Spray density and particle distribution feel natural (randomized scatter)
  - [x] G3 â€” Spray paths sync in real-time (<100ms) across all collaborators
  - [x] G4 â€” Spraying maintains 60 FPS performance with 50+ shapes on canvas
  - [x] G5 â€” AI can programmatically create spray effects via createSpray() method

---

## 3. Non-Goals / Out of Scope

Call out anything intentionally excluded to avoid partial implementations and hidden dependencies.

- [ ] Not implementing variable particle size within a spray
- [ ] Not implementing particle fade/opacity variation (uniform opacity)
- [ ] Not implementing spray patterns/shapes (circular area only)
- [ ] Not implementing airbrush flow rate controls (constant density)
- [ ] Not implementing particle blending modes (normal blend only)
- [ ] Not implementing spray texture brushes (solid circles only)
- [ ] Not implementing spray angle/direction controls (radial only)
- [ ] Not implementing spray smoothing or interpolation between frames

---

## 4. Success Metrics

- **User-visible:** 
  - Spraying feels smooth and natural (random particle distribution)
  - Spray density is controllable and predictable
  - Spray area clearly visible during application
  - Results match MS Paint spray can tool aesthetic
  
- **System:** 
  - Real-time sync: <100ms from spray to peer visibility
  - 60 FPS maintained during spraying with 50+ shapes
  - Particle data efficiently stored (particles grouped per spray stroke)
  
- **Quality:** 
  - 0 blocking bugs
  - All acceptance gates pass
  - Multi-user spraying works without conflicts

---

## 5. Users & Stories

- As a **postcard creator**, I want to **spray clouds and textures** so that I can **create natural-looking scenes with soft edges and depth**.

- As a **collaborative artist**, I want to **see my partner's spray effects appear in real-time** so that we can **build scenes together with textured elements**.

- As an **AI assistant user**, I want the **AI to spray clouds, grass, and textures programmatically** so that it can **create realistic scenes based on my prompts**.

## 6. Experience Specification (UX)

### Entry Points and Flows
1. User clicks spray paint tool button (ðŸ’¨ icon) in left toolbar
2. Cursor changes to circle representing spray radius when hovering over canvas
3. User clicks and drags (or holds) to spray particles
4. Particles appear in real-time with random scatter within spray radius
5. On mouse release, spray stroke is finalized and synced to Firestore
6. Spray stroke remains as permanent shape on canvas

### Visual Behavior
- **Tool button:** Spray can icon (ðŸ’¨) in ToolPalette
- **Active state:** Button highlighted when spray tool active
- **Cursor:** Circle outline showing spray radius during spraying
- **Preview:** Particles appear instantly as user holds/drags mouse
- **Final spray:** Collection of small circles forming textured effect
- **Color:** Inherits current selected color from ColorPalette
- **Radius:** Configurable spray radius (default: 20px, range: 10-50px)
- **Density:** Configurable particle density (particles per frame)

### States
- **Default:** Tool button visible but not selected
- **Active:** Tool selected, ready to spray
- **Spraying:** Mouse down, particles being generated (preview visible)
- **Syncing:** Spray being saved to Firestore (~50-100ms)
- **Synced:** Spray visible to all users

### Accessibility
- Keyboard shortcut: `S` key to activate spray paint tool
- Tool button has aria-label="Spray Paint Tool"
- Focus visible on tool button
- Tooltip shows "Spray Paint Tool (S)" on hover

### Performance
- 60 FPS during spraying (no dropped frames)
- Particle generation at 30-60 Hz (smooth spray effect)
- Network sync <100ms after mouse release

## 12. Test Plan & Acceptance Gates

---

## 14. Risks & Mitigations

**Risk:** Spray rendering performance degrades with many particles
- **Mitigation:** Use Konva Group component for particle batching; test with 500+ particles per spray

**Risk:** Firestore document size limits (spray with 10,000 particles could exceed 1MB)
- **Mitigation:** Limit particles per spray stroke (cap at ~1000 particles); split into multiple spray shapes if needed

**Risk:** Real-time sync latency >100ms for large sprays
- **Mitigation:** Optimize particle data structure; use Firestore batch writes

**Risk:** Particle generation CPU intensive during spraying
- **Mitigation:** Throttle particle generation to 30 FPS; use efficient random algorithm

**Risk:** Multi-user spray conflicts (two users spraying at same time)
- **Mitigation:** Each spray is independent document, no conflict possible

**Risk:** Spray cursor circle rendering affects performance
- **Mitigation:** Use CSS cursor or simple Canvas overlay, not full Konva layer

---

## 15. Rollout & Telemetry

**Feature flag?** No (core feature, always on)

**Metrics:**
- Usage: Count of sprays created per session
- Errors: Firestore write failures, validation errors
- Latency: Time from mouse up to spray visible (target <100ms)
- Performance: FPS during spraying (target 60 FPS)
- Particle counts: Average particles per spray, max particles per spray

**Manual validation steps post-deploy:**
1. Spray several effects, verify natural appearance
2. Test real-time sync in 2 browser windows
3. Test with 50+ shapes, verify 60 FPS
4. Test keyboard shortcut (S key)
5. Test spray selection, move, rotate, delete
6. Test spray with different colors and radius settings

---

## 16. Open Questions

**Q1:** Should spray support variable particle sizes within a spray?
- **Answer:** No, uniform particle size for MVP. Variation can be added in future PR.

**Q2:** Should we support adjustable spray density controls in the UI?
- **Answer:** Start with fixed density (5 particles/frame), add UI controls in PR #7 (stroke width selector) if needed.

**Q3:** What particle generation rate should we use?
- **Answer:** 5 particles per frame at 30 FPS = ~150 particles/second. Tune based on testing for natural appearance.

**Q4:** Should particles fade at edges of spray radius?
- **Answer:** No, uniform opacity for MVP. Gradient/fade is nice-to-have for future PR.

---

## 17. Appendix: Out-of-Scope Backlog

Items explicitly deferred for future work with brief rationale.

- [ ] **Variable particle size:** Size variation within spray requires complex rendering, defer
- [ ] **Opacity variation:** Particle fade/transparency is advanced feature
- [ ] **Spray patterns:** Star, square, custom shapes require pattern editor
- [ ] **Airbrush mode:** Flow rate controls and continuous spray are advanced features
- [ ] **Particle blending:** Blend modes (multiply, screen) require shader support
- [ ] **Textured brushes:** Bitmap textures for particles are nice-to-have
- [ ] **Spray angle controls:** Directional spray requires vector math and UI
- [ ] **Spray smoothing:** Interpolation between frames is optimization, not MVP

## Authoring Notes

- Test Plan written before coding
- Every sub-task has a pass/fail gate
- Vertical slice: complete spray painting feature
- Service layer is deterministic and testable
- UI is a thin wrapper around services
- Particle generation algorithm must be efficient and natural-looking
