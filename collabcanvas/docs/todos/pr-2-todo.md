## 0. Clarifying Questions & Assumptions

**Questions:**
- None - all requirements clear from PRD and PR brief

**Assumptions:**
- Using existing Firestore infrastructure (no new collections needed)
- Sprays stored as standard shapes in `canvases/main/shapes` collection
- Particle generation at 5 particles per frame (30 FPS = ~150 particles/second)
- Default spray radius of 20px
- Default particle size of 2px
- Keyboard shortcut 'S' follows existing pattern
- Particles stored as array of objects with x, y, size properties
- Random scatter within circular area using uniform distribution

## Notes

### Particle Generation Algorithm
- Use polar coordinates for uniform distribution within circle
- Random angle: `Î¸ = random() * 2Ï€`
- Random radius: `r = sqrt(random()) * sprayRadius` (square root for uniform density)
- Convert to Cartesian: `x = r * cos(Î¸)`, `y = r * sin(Î¸)`
- Particles stored relative to spray's bounding box origin

### Storage Strategy
- Group all particles from one spray stroke into single Firestore document
- Particles array: `[{x: number, y: number, size: number}, ...]`
- Calculate bounding box: `minX, minY, maxX, maxY` from all particles
- Store particles with positions relative to (x, y) origin

### Rendering Strategy
- Map particles to Konva Circle components
- Consider using Konva Group for performance with many particles
- Apply color and rotation at spray level (transform entire group)
- Selection and lock indicators applied to bounding box

### Performance Considerations
- Throttle particle generation to 30 FPS (16ms intervals minimum)
- Limit particles per spray stroke (soft cap at ~1000 particles)
- Use efficient random number generation (Math.random() is fine)
- Batch Firestore writes (single document write per spray stroke)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Canvas.tsx Changes
```typescript
// Add state for spray tool
const [isSpraying, setIsSpraying] = useState(false);
const [currentSprayParticles, setCurrentSprayParticles] = useState<Array<{x, y, size}>>([]);
const lastSprayTimeRef = useRef(0);

// Mouse down handler
const handleSprayMouseDown = (e) => {
  if (activeTool !== 'spray') return;
  setIsSpraying(true);
  generateSprayParticles(e.evt.clientX, e.evt.clientY);
};

// Mouse move handler (throttled to 30 FPS)
const handleSprayMouseMove = (e) => {
  if (!isSpraying) return;
  const now = Date.now();
  if (now - lastSprayTimeRef.current < 33) return; // 30 FPS throttle
  lastSprayTimeRef.current = now;
  generateSprayParticles(e.evt.clientX, e.evt.clientY);
};

// Mouse up handler
const handleSprayMouseUp = async () => {
  if (!isSpraying) return;
  setIsSpraying(false);
  await createSpray(currentSprayParticles, selectedColor, sprayRadius, particleSize);
  setCurrentSprayParticles([]);
};
```

### sprayHelpers.ts Structure
```typescript
export function generateSprayParticles(
  centerX: number,
  centerY: number,
  radius: number,
  density: number,
  particleSize: number
): Array<{x: number, y: number, size: number}> {
  const particles = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < density; i++) {
    const angle = Math.random() * 2 * Math.PI;
    const r = Math.sqrt(Math.random()) * radius;
    const x = centerX + r * Math.cos(angle);
    const y = centerY + r * Math.sin(angle);
    particles.push({ x, y, size: particleSize });
  }
  return particles;
}

export function calculateParticleBoundingBox(
  particles: Array<{x: number, y: number, size: number}>
): { x: number, y: number, width: number, height: number } {
  if (particles.length === 0) {
    return { x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 0 };
  }
  
  const xs = particles.map(p => p.x);
  const ys = particles.map(p => p.y);
  const minX = Math.min(...xs);
  const minY = Math.min(...ys);
  const maxX = Math.max(...xs);
  const maxY = Math.max(...ys);
  
  return {
    x: minX,
    y: minY,
    width: maxX - minX,
    height: maxY - minY
  };
}

export function makeParticlesRelative(
  particles: Array<{x: number, y: number, size: number}>,
  originX: number,
  originY: number
): Array<{x: number, y: number, size: number}> {
  return particles.map(p => ({
    x: p.x - originX,
    y: p.y - originY,
    size: p.size
  }));
}
```
