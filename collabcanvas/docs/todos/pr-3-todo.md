## Notes & Implementation Strategy

### Algorithm Choice: Pixel-based Flood Fill
- Use scanline or queue-based flood-fill for reliability
- Rasterize canvas to ImageData for pixel color access
- Convert filled pixels to polygon using marching squares
- Simplify polygon to reduce vertex count

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Timeout Protection:** Stop algorithm after 2 seconds to prevent hang
2. **Max Pixel Limit:** Reject fills larger than 10,000 pixels
3. **Efficient Data Structures:** Use Set for pixel tracking, optimize loops
4. **Canvas Caching:** Consider caching rasterization if multiple fills in quick succession
5. **Polygon Simplification:** Use Douglas-Peucker or similar to reduce fillPoints size

### Key Technical Challenges
1. **Canvas Rasterization:** Need accurate pixel representation of all shapes
2. **Boundary Detection:** Fill must stop at shape edges, not leak through
3. **Tolerance Matching:** Color matching must be consistent and predictable
4. **Polygon Conversion:** Marching squares can produce complex polygons - need simplification
5. **Performance:** Large fills can be slow - need timeout and feedback

### Testing Strategy
- Unit test flood-fill algorithm in isolation with mock ImageData
- Integration test with real canvas rasterization
- Performance test with various fill sizes and complexities
- Multi-user test with concurrent fills
- Edge case test with complex scenes and boundaries

### Firestore Considerations
- Fill shapes use same collection as other shapes
- fillPoints array might be large - monitor document sizes
- Consider polygon simplification to keep under 1MB limit
- Standard shape operations (move, delete) work automatically

### UI/UX Considerations
- Loading indicator during fill processing (can take 100-500ms)
- Error messages for timeout, too large, outside bounds
- Tolerance slider with visual feedback (current value display)
- Bucket cursor provides clear feedback of active tool
- Tool remains active for multiple fills (no need to re-select)

## Debugging Tips

### If fills are leaking through boundaries:
- Check z-index sorting in rasterizeCanvas()
- Verify shape rendering accuracy in rasterization
- Ensure tolerance isn't too high (try tolerance=0)

### If fills are too slow:
- Profile flood-fill algorithm
- Check for infinite loops (timeout should catch)
- Reduce MAX_FILL_PIXELS limit
- Consider async processing with web worker

### If fills don't sync:
- Check Firestore write success
- Verify fillPoints array is valid
- Check for bounding box calculation errors
- Test with Firestore emulator first

### If polygon rendering is wrong:
- Check marching squares implementation
- Verify polygon is closed (first point = last point)
- Check for self-intersecting polygons
- Simplify polygon if too many vertices
