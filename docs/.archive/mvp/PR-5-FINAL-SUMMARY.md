## 🎯 Feature Highlights

### Visual Indicators
```
Unlocked:       ┌─────────┐  (Black border, 1px)

Locked by other: ┌─────────┐  (Red border, 3px + 🔒 icon + 50% opacity)
```

### User Interactions
- **Click unlocked shape** → Lock acquired (green border)
- **Click locked shape** → Toast: "Shape locked by [username]"
- **Drag locked shape** → Position updates + auto-unlock
- **Click background** → Deselect and unlock
- **Wait 5 seconds** → Auto-unlock

### Real-time Sync
- Lock status: <50ms visual feedback
- Position updates: <100ms to other users
- Toast notifications: Instant

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### What Worked Well
- **Service-layer abstraction:** Clean separation between UI and data
- **Context pattern:** Easy state sharing across components
- **Konva Groups:** Perfect for complex visual indicators
- **react-hot-toast:** Simple, effective user feedback

### Design Decisions
- **5-second timeout:** Balances usability and lock freshness
- **Non-atomic locks:** Acceptable for MVP, upgrade post-launch
- **Client-side timeout:** Simpler implementation, good enough for MVP
- **One lock per user:** Keeps UX simple, prevents confusion

### Future Improvements
- Upgrade to Firestore transactions for atomic locks
- Add lock queue/request system
- Real-time position updates during drag (not just on end)
- Keyboard shortcuts (ESC to deselect)
