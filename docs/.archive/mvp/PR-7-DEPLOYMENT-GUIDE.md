- [ ] Open 2 browser windows (or incognito + normal)
- [ ] Both users can see each other's cursors moving
- [ ] Cursor updates are smooth (<50ms latency)
- [ ] Presence list shows both users
- [ ] When one user disconnects, presence updates immediately

#### Canvas Features Test
- [ ] Can pan the canvas (drag or spacebar)
- [ ] Can zoom in/out (mouse wheel)
- [ ] Color toolbar works (all 4 colors)
- [ ] Can create rectangles by clicking and dragging
- [ ] Other users see shapes appear in real-time (<100ms)
- [ ] Shapes persist after page refresh

#### Locking Features Test
- [ ] User A can select and drag a shape
- [ ] User B sees the shape as locked (red border)
- [ ] User B cannot interact with locked shape
- [ ] Lock releases when User A deselects or finishes dragging
- [ ] Toast notifications appear for lock conflicts

#### Performance Test
- [ ] Open 5+ browser windows with different accounts
- [ ] Create 50+ shapes
- [ ] Verify cursor updates remain smooth
- [ ] Verify shape creation/movement remains responsive
- [ ] Check browser dev tools: 60 FPS maintained
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended session
