## üí° Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Password Requirements
- **Date:** October 14, 2025
- **Decision:** 
  - Minimum 8 characters (industry standard)
  - At least one uppercase letter
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character
- **Rationale:** Follows NIST guidelines and common industry practices
- **Alternatives:** 
  - 6 characters (too weak for modern standards)
  - 12 characters (too strict for MVP)

### Decision 2: Special Characters Allowed
- **Date:** October 14, 2025
- **Decision:** Allow standard special characters: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?`
- **Rationale:** Covers most commonly used special characters, Firebase-compatible
- **Alternatives:** Could allow all special characters, but keeping it standard for simplicity

### Decision 3: Real-Time UI Feedback
- **Date:** October 14, 2025
- **Decision:** Update requirement indicators in real-time as user types
- **Rationale:** Modern UX pattern, helps users understand requirements immediately
- **Alternatives:** Validate only on blur/submit (less user-friendly)

- Implementation was straightforward - no complex architecture changes needed
- UX implementation successful: clear visual feedback with smooth 0.2s transitions
- Color contrast is accessible (#ef4444 for red, #10b981 for green)
- Password requirements follow industry standards (NIST-aligned)
- Special characters regex covers standard set: `!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:",.<>?`
- Firebase's built-in validation will still catch edge cases server-side
- **BONUS:** Added password visibility toggle (eye icon) to both Signup and Login pages
  - User requested feature
  - SVG icons for clean rendering
  - Accessible with aria-labels
  - Positioned inside input field (right side)
  - Smooth hover transitions
- Future enhancement: Consider password strength meter (post-MVP)
