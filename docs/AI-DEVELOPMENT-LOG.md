## Project Overview

### What We Built

A real-time collaborative design canvas enabling multiple users to:
- Draw shapes simultaneously with click-and-drag
- See each other's cursors in real-time (<50ms latency)
- Lock shapes with first-click-wins mechanism
- Pan and zoom a 5000×5000px workspace
- All with 60 FPS performance

### Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Konva.js  
**Backend:** Firebase (Hybrid: RTDB for cursors, Firestore for shapes)  
**Deployment:** Vercel  
**Testing:** Vitest + Firebase Emulators

### Development Approach

**Key Innovation:** Structured AI collaboration through:
1. **Incremental PRs** - 10 feature-scoped pull requests
2. **Documentation-First** - Test plans before code
3. **Template-Driven** - Standardized PR docs (Summary, Test Plan, Quick Start)
4. **Automation** - Custom PR creation script

---

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles

#### 1. **Test Plans Before Code**

**The Pattern:**
```
1. Write test plan (what success looks like)
2. Show AI the test plan
3. AI implements to pass tests
4. Run tests
5. Document what was built
```

**Why It Works:**
- AI has clear success criteria
- Catches edge cases before coding
- Prevents scope creep
- Results in passing tests first try

**Example Prompt:**
```
Create a test plan for cursor sync following:
docs/templates/PR-TEST-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md

Include:
- Setup instructions
- Test scenarios with explicit steps
- Multi-user tests (2-3 browsers)
- Performance targets (FPS, latency)
- Edge cases (disconnect, bounds)

Make tests EXPLICIT:
❌ "Test that cursors work"
✅ "User A moves mouse → User B sees cursor within 50ms"
```

#### 2. **Documentation as Context**

**The Insight:** Well-structured docs = AI context memory

**What We Created:**
- `prd.md` (35KB) - Product requirements
- `task.md` (13KB) - Implementation tasks
- `architecture.md` (4.2KB) - Technical decisions
- `AI-PROMPTS.md` - Reusable prompt templates
- `GOTCHAS.md` - Lessons learned (real-time updated)

**How We Used Them:**
```
# At start of each session
Prompt: "Implement cursor sync according to task.md PR #3.
Reference architecture.md for service layer pattern.
Follow test plan in PR-3-TEST-PLAN.md."

Result: AI has full context, implements correctly
```

#### 3. **Incremental, Reversible Progress**

**Branch Strategy:**
```
main
 ├─ setup/emulators-and-scaffold (PR #0)
 ├─ feature/authentication (PR #1)
 ├─ feature/canvas-core (PR #2)
 ├─ feature/realtime-cursors-presence (PR #3)
 ├─ feature/shapes-create-and-sync (PR #4)
 ├─ feature/shapes-locking-and-drag (PR #5)
 ├─ fix/rules-tests-polish (PR #6)
 ├─ deploy/vercel-prod (PR #7)
 ├─ fix/auth-form (PR #8-10)
 └─ ui/facelift (PR #10)
```

**Each PR:**
- Self-contained feature
- Complete test plan
- Documentation bundle (Summary, Test Plan, Quick Start)
- Mergeable and deployable

---

## The PR Workflow

### PR Structure (Repeated 10 Times)

#### Stage 1: Planning (AI Prompt #1)

**Prompt Template:**
```
You are planning [feature name] for CollabCanvas.

Feature: [2-3 sentence description]

Create a test plan following:
@docs/templates/PR-TEST-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md

Include:
1. Setup instructions
2. Test scenarios with explicit steps
3. Multi-user testing scenarios
4. Performance targets
5. Edge cases

Reference: @docs/archive/PR-3-TEST-PLAN.md for format
Save as: PR-[N]-TEST-PLAN.md
```

**AI Output:** Comprehensive test plan with 20-30 test cases

#### Stage 2: Implementation (AI Prompt #2)

**Prompt Template:**
```
Implement [feature name] according to PR-[N]-TEST-PLAN.md.

Architecture constraints:
- Use service layer pattern (@src/services/)
- Follow existing code style (@src/components/Canvas/)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Cleanup in useEffect hooks

As you implement:
1. Update PR-[N]-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md with progress
2. Note architecture decisions
3. Flag blockers

When complete, ensure all test cases pass.
```

**AI Output:** Feature implementation with progress tracking

#### Stage 3: Testing & Debugging

**The Reality:** AI implementations often need iteration

**Common Pattern:**
```
AI: "Implementation complete!"
Developer: *Tests in browser*
Browser: *White screen, console error*

Developer: "Getting error: [paste exact error]"
AI: "Ah, that's because [root cause]. Fix: [solution]"
Developer: *Applies fix*
Browser: *Works!*
```

**Key Insight:** Paste exact error messages, AI debugging is excellent

#### Stage 4: Documentation (AI Prompts #3-4)

**PR Summary Prompt:**
```
Create PR summary for completed [feature name].

Following: @docs/templates/PR-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md

Include:
1. Implementation Overview
2. Files Created/Modified (with purpose)
3. Architecture Decisions (WHY not just WHAT)
4. Testing Instructions
5. Known Issues/Limitations
6. Next Steps

Reference: @docs/archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md
Save as: PR-[N]-SUMMARY.md
```

**Quick Start Prompt:**
```
Create 2-minute validation guide for [feature name].

Following: @docs/templates/PR-QUICK-START-TEMPLATE.md

KEEP IT UNDER 20 LINES.

Include:
- Prerequisites (1 line)
- Setup (2-3 commands)
- Test steps (3-5 actions)
- Expected result

Save as: PR-[N]-QUICK-START.md
```

#### Stage 5: PR Creation (Automated)

**The Script:** `create-pr.sh`

```bash
$ pr

# Script analyzes commits
# Finds PR-[N]-SUMMARY.md
# Extracts content
# Generates PR description
# Pushes branch
# Creates PR via GitHub CLI
# Opens in browser

Time: 10 seconds (vs 5-10 minutes manual)
```

## AI Prompting Strategies

### What Worked

#### 1. **Reference Existing Files**

**Pattern:**
```
Following: @docs/templates/PR-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md
Reference format: @docs/archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md
```

**Why:** AI sees exact format and matches it perfectly

#### 2. **Be Explicit About Context**

**Good:**
```
Implement cursor sync according to task.md PR #3.
Use service layer pattern (see src/services/).
Target: 30 FPS, <50ms latency.
```

**Bad:**
```
Make cursors work
```

#### 3. **Chunk Complex Tasks**

**Instead of:**
```
"Build the entire authentication system"
```

**Do:**
```
Session 1: "Create AuthService with signup/login methods"
Session 2: "Create AuthContext wrapping AuthService"
Session 3: "Build Login/Signup UI components"
```

#### 4. **Show Don't Tell**

**Instead of:**
```
"Format the summary like previous PRs"
```

**Do:**
```
"Format like @docs/archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md"
```

AI reads the file, matches exactly

#### 5. **Document Gotchas Immediately**

**The Pattern:**
```
Hit bug → Fix bug → IMMEDIATELY prompt:

"Document this bug in GOTCHAS.md:

Issue: [what went wrong]
Symptoms: [what I saw]
Root cause: [technical explanation]
Solution: [exact fix with code]
Prevention: [how to avoid]"
```

**Why:** Fresh in memory, complete details, searchable later

### What Didn't Work

#### 1. **Vague Requirements**

**Bad Prompt:**
```
"Make the canvas better"
```

**Result:** AI confused, asks questions, wastes time

**Fix:** Be specific about success criteria

#### 2. **Assuming Context Across Sessions**

**The Problem:** New chat = blank slate

**Bad Assumption:**
```
"Continue working on the cursor feature"
(Which cursor feature? What's the state?)
```

**Solution:** Start each session with context:
```
"We're implementing cursor sync (PR #3).
Current state: AuthService done, need CursorService.
Follow: task.md PR #3, reference: architecture.md service layer."
```

#### 3. **Not Providing Error Messages**

**Bad:**
```
"It's not working"
```

**Good:**
```
"Getting error: 'Cannot read property x of undefined' at Canvas.tsx:47
Here's the code: [paste relevant snippet]"
```

AI debugging is excellent if you give it the error

#### 4. **Trying to Do Everything in One Prompt**

**The Mistake:**
```
"Build auth, cursor sync, and shapes in one go"
```

**Result:** Overwhelmed AI, incomplete implementation

**Fix:** One PR at a time, following task.md sequence

## PR Automation: The Script

### The Problem

Creating PRs manually is tedious:
1. Push branch (command line)
2. Open GitHub (browser)
3. Click "New Pull Request"
4. Copy-paste from PR-X-SUMMARY.md
5. Format markdown
6. Create PR
7. Navigate to PR

**Time:** 5-10 minutes per PR  
**With 10 PRs:** 50-100 minutes wasted

### The Solution: `create-pr.sh`

**Script Goals:**
1. Analyze commits automatically
2. Find PR documentation
3. Generate beautiful PR description
4. Push branch
5. Create PR via GitHub CLI
6. Open in browser

**Time:** 10 seconds per PR  
**With 10 PRs:** Saved ~80 minutes

### How We Built It

**Session 1: Requirements**
```
Prompt: "I want to automate PR creation. Goals:
1. Analyze commits in current branch
2. Find PR-X-SUMMARY.md for this branch
3. Extract content sections
4. Generate PR description with:
   - Summary
   - Features implemented
   - Checklist
   - Files changed
   - Commits
5. Push branch and create PR via gh CLI

Create a bash script that does this."
```

**AI Output:** Initial script (90% working)

**Session 2: Refinement**
```
Developer: *Tests script*
"Issues:
1. Doesn't handle PR number extraction
2. Missing markdown formatting
3. No error handling for missing docs"

Prompt: "Fix these issues: [paste issues]"
```

**AI Output:** Fixed script

**Session 3: Polish**
```
Prompt: "Add:
1. Color-coded output (success=green, error=red)
2. Progress indicators
3. Preview of PR description
4. Option to open in browser

Make it beautiful for terminal output."
```

**AI Output:** Polished script with beautiful UX

### Script Features

**Intelligence:**
- Extracts PR number from branch name (`feature/pr-4-shapes` → looks for `PR-4-*.md`)
- Parses markdown to extract sections
- Generates comprehensive PR description
- Falls back to commit messages if no docs found

**User Experience:**
```bash
$ pr

╔════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  PR Creation Script - Pre-flight Checks

## Context Windows & Restarts

### The Reality of Long Projects

**Challenge:** AI context windows are limited (even at 200K tokens)

**What Happens:**
- You're deep in implementation
- Context full of prior discussions
- AI starts "forgetting" earlier decisions
- Need to restart conversation

### Our Strategy: Documentation as Memory

**The Pattern:**
```
When context getting full:
1. Summarize current state → PR-X-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md
2. Document decisions → ARCHITECTURE.md or GOTCHAS.md
3. Start fresh session
4. Load context: "@prd.md @task.md @PR-X-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md"
```

### Restart Scenarios

#### Restart Type 1: Planned (Between PRs)

**Situation:** Finished PR #3, starting PR #4

**Strategy:**
```
# New session
Prompt: "We're starting PR #4: Shape Creation & Sync.

Context:
- PR #0-3 complete (auth, canvas, cursors done)
- Follow: @task.md PR #4 section
- Architecture: @architecture.md service layer pattern
- Test plan: @PR-4-TEST-PLAN.md

Begin implementation."
```

**Key:** Fresh start with full context loaded

#### Restart Type 2: Mid-Implementation (Context Full)

**Situation:** Deep in PR #5, context at 180K tokens, AI losing coherence

**Strategy:**
```
Before restart:
Prompt: "Update PR-5-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md with:
1. What's complete
2. What's in progress
3. What's blocked
4. Any decisions made"

# New session
Prompt: "Continuing PR #5: Shape Locking.

Current state: @PR-5-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md
Follow: @task.md PR #5
Test when done: @PR-5-TEST-PLAN.md

Continue from where we left off."
```

**Key:** Status doc preserves context across restarts

#### Restart Type 3: Bug Investigation

**Situation:** Hit a tricky bug, need fresh perspective

**Strategy:**
```
# First session (getting stuck)
Developer: "Cursors not showing up"
AI: *Tries 3-4 solutions, none work*

# New session
Prompt: "Fresh debugging session.

Issue: Cursors not appearing for remote users
Symptoms: Local cursor works, others don't see it
Already tried: [list what didn't work]
Relevant code: @src/hooks/useCursors.ts

What could cause this?"
```

**Key:** Fresh eyes often spot what tired context missed

### Tools for Context Management

#### 1. **Implementation Status Docs**

**Purpose:** Serialize current state for next session

**Template:**
```markdown
## ✅ Completed
- [x] Task 1 with details
- [x] Task 2 with details

## 🚧 In Progress
- [ ] Task 3
  - Subpart A done
  - Subpart B blocked by X

## ❓ Blocked
- Issue: [description]
- Attempted: [what we tried]

## 💡 Decisions Made
- Decision: [what we chose]
- Rationale: [why]
```

#### 2. **GOTCHAS.md (Living Document)**

**Purpose:** Capture lessons learned in real-time

**Pattern:**
```
Hit bug → Fix bug → IMMEDIATELY:

Prompt: "Document in GOTCHAS.md:

### [Bug Title]

**Issue:** [1-2 sentences]
**Symptoms:** [what you see]
**Root Cause:** [technical explanation]
**Solution:** [code fix]
**Prevention:** [how to avoid]"
```

**Why Immediately:** Details fresh, context clear

#### 3. **Git History as Context**

**Pattern:**
```
Prompt: "What changed in PR #4?
See: git log main..feature/pr-4-shapes"

AI: *Reads commit history*
"PR #4 implemented shape creation:
- Added canvasService.createShape()
- Implemented click-and-drag preview
- ..."
```

**Key:** Git commits = context preserved forever

### Metrics

**Average Session Length:** 45-90 minutes  
**Restarts Per PR:** 1-3  
**Context Loss:** Minimal (due to docs strategy)  
**Time Lost to Restarts:** ~5 minutes per restart (loading context)

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

#### 1. **Test Plans Before Code** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Impact:** Saved 2-4 hours per PR

**Why:**
- AI had clear success criteria
- Caught edge cases before coding
- Tests passed first try
- No scope creep

**Example:**
PR #3 test plan revealed coordinate transformation issue before implementation

#### 2. **Template-Driven Documentation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Impact:** Consistent, high-quality docs with zero cognitive load

**Templates Created:**
- PR-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md
- PR-TEST-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md
- PR-QUICK-START-TEMPLATE.md
- PR-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS-TEMPLATE.md

**Pattern:**
```
Prompt: "Create PR summary following:
@docs/templates/PR-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md
Reference: @docs/archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md"

Result: Perfect format, every time
```

#### 3. **PR Automation Script** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Impact:** Saved 80+ minutes across project

**Before:** 5-10 min per PR × 10 PRs = 50-100 min  
**After:** 10 sec per PR × 10 PRs = ~2 min  
**Savings:** 95-98%

**Bonus:** Consistent PR quality, never forget sections

#### 4. **Incremental PRs** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Impact:** Always deployable, easy to review, manageable complexity

**Pattern:**
```
PR #0: Setup
PR #1: Auth (depends on #0)
PR #2: Canvas (depends on #1)
PR #3: Cursors (depends on #2)
...
```

**Why It Works:**
- Each PR self-contained
- Can deploy after any PR
- Easy to review (focused scope)
- Clear checkpoints

#### 5. **GOTCHAS.md (Living Document)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Impact:** Saved 3-4 hours debugging common issues

**Pattern:** Hit bug → Fix → Document immediately

**Example:**
"Semver error" hit 3 times:
1. First: 1 hour debugging
2. Second: 30 seconds (searched GOTCHAS.md)
3. Third: Didn't happen (team read GOTCHAS.md)

### What Could Be Improved

#### 1. **Initial Context Loading** ⭐⭐⭐

**Issue:** Each restart needs 5 minutes to reload context

**Current:**
```
Prompt: "Load: @prd.md @task.md @architecture.md @PR-X-STATUS.md"
AI: *Reads 4 files*
```

**Better:** Single "session-context.md" file
```markdown
# Current Session Context
- Project: CollabCanvas
- Phase: PR #5 implementation
- Prior PRs: #0-4 complete
- Current task: Shape locking
- Key files: src/services/canvasService.ts
```

#### 2. **Error Message Formatting** ⭐⭐⭐

**Issue:** Pasting raw console errors loses formatting

**Current:**
```
Prompt: "Error: [paste messy console error]"
```

**Better:** Use code blocks
```
Prompt: "Getting error:
'''
Error: Cannot read property 'x' of undefined
  at Canvas.tsx:47:12
  at...
'''
"
```

#### 3. **Code Context in Prompts** ⭐⭐⭐

**Issue:** Sometimes AI needs to see more code than what's in error

**Current:**
```
Prompt: "Error at Canvas.tsx:47"
```

**Better:**
```
Prompt: "Error at Canvas.tsx:47

Code context:
'''typescript
// Lines 40-55
const handleMouseMove = (e) => {
  const stage = e.target.getStage();
  const pointer = stage.getPointerPosition(); // Line 47
  ...
}
'''
"
```

#### 4. **Architecture Decision Recording** ⭐⭐

**Issue:** Decisions sometimes lost across sessions

**Current:** Mentioned in PR summaries, scattered

**Better:** Dedicated ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md
```markdown
## ADR-001: Hybrid Database (RTDB + Firestore)

**Context:** Need <50ms cursors AND structured queries
**Decision:** RTDB for cursors, Firestore for shapes
**Rationale:** Use best tool for each job
**Status:** Implemented in PR #3
**Result:** Hit all performance targets
```

### Unexpected Wins

#### 1. **AI Debugging is Excellent**

**Discovery:** AI debugging often faster than human

**Example:**
```
Developer: "Getting 'onSnapshot is not a function'"
AI: "That's because you imported from 'firebase/firestore' not 'firebase/firestore/lite'.
Lite version doesn't include listeners."
Developer: "Wow, that was fast"
```

**Lesson:** Always paste exact errors to AI

#### 2. **Templates Reduce Cognitive Load**

**Discovery:** Never thought "What sections go in a PR summary?"

**Before Templates:** 5-10 min figuring out what to write  
**After Templates:** 30 sec prompting AI with template

**Lesson:** Templates are productivity multipliers

#### 3. **Documentation Prevents Regression**

**Discovery:** GOTCHAS.md prevented same bugs multiple times

**Example:**
Coordinate transformation gotcha documented in PR #3, prevented bug in PR #4

**Lesson:** Real-time documentation has compounding value

#### 4. **Service Layer Paid Off Huge**

**Discovery:** Clean architecture made AI implementation easier

**Why:**
- AI could reference existing service patterns
- Consistent API across features
- Easy to test
- Ready for AI agent integration (Phase 2)

**Lesson:** Good architecture helps both humans AND AI

### Mistakes We Made (And Fixed)

#### Mistake 1: Vague Initial Requirements

**What Happened:**
Early sessions: "Make auth work"
AI: "What kind of auth? What's the user flow?"
*Wasted 20 minutes clarifying*

**Fix:**
Created comprehensive prd.md with explicit requirements

**Lesson:** Time spent on clear requirements = 10x saved in implementation

#### Mistake 2: Not Documenting Gotchas Immediately

**What Happened:**
Fixed tricky cursor bounds bug, didn't document
Next session: Hit similar bug, forgot solution, re-debugged for 30 min

**Fix:**
Mandatory: Fix bug → IMMEDIATELY document in GOTCHAS.md

**Lesson:** Documentation 5 minutes after = easy. 5 hours after = impossible.

#### Mistake 3: Trying to Do Too Much Per Session

**What Happened:**
Early PR #3: "Implement cursor sync AND presence AND automatic cleanup"
AI got confused, produced incomplete implementation

**Fix:**
Break into chunks:
- Session 1: Cursor position tracking
- Session 2: Cursor rendering
- Session 3: Presence system
- Session 4: onDisconnect cleanup

**Lesson:** Chunk work to fit in one focused session

#### Mistake 4: Not Testing AI Output Before Moving On

**What Happened:**
AI: "Implementation complete!"
Developer: "Great!" *Moves to next feature*
Browser: *White screen*

**Fix:**
Mandatory: AI completes → Test in browser → Fix issues → Then move on

**Lesson:** "It compiles" ≠ "It works"
