# AI Development Log: CollabCanvas MVP

**Project:** Real-time collaborative canvas with AI pair programming  
**Duration:** October 2024 - October 2025 (~40 hours active dev)  
**AI Tools:** Claude (Cursor IDE)  
**Result:** 10 PRs, 5,000+ LOC, production-ready MVP

---

## The Big Picture

Built a real-time collaborative canvas (React + Firebase + Konva) using structured AI collaboration. Key innovation: **Documentation-first workflow** that turned AI from code generator into genuine pair programmer.

**What We Built:**
- Multi-user canvas with <50ms cursor sync
- Real-time shape creation and locking
- 60 FPS performance
- 5,000+ lines of production code
- ~3,000 lines of documentation

---

## The Process: 5-Stage PR Workflow (×10 PRs)

### Stage 1: Test Plan First (AI-Generated)

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
"Create test plan for [feature] following @templates/PR-TEST-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md
Include explicit steps, multi-user scenarios, performance targets.
Reference: @archive/PR-3-TEST-PLAN.md"
```

**Why This Works:**
- AI has clear success criteria
- Catches edge cases before coding
- Tests pass first try
- Prevents scope creep

**Time:** 5 min (was 30-45 min manual)

### Stage 2: Implementation (AI-Driven)

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
"Implement [feature] per PR-X-TEST-PLAN.md
Architecture: @architecture.md service layer
Update PR-X-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md as you work"
```

**Reality:** Often needs iteration
```
AI: "Done!" 
Dev: *tests* → white screen
Dev: "Error: [paste exact error]"
AI: "Ah, fix: [solution]"
```

**Key:** Paste exact errors, AI debugging is excellent

### Stage 3: Testing & Debugging

**Best Practices:**
- Test immediately (don't trust "it compiles")
- Paste exact error messages with context
- Use fresh session if stuck (new perspective)

### Stage 4: Documentation (AI-Generated)

**Prompt Pattern:**
```
"Create PR summary following @templates/PR-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md
Include: overview, files changed, architecture decisions, gotchas
Reference: @archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md"
```

**Output:** Consistent, comprehensive docs every time

**Time:** 10 min (was 60 min manual)

### Stage 5: PR Creation (Automated)

Built bash script: `create-pr.sh`
- Analyzes commits
- Finds/parses PR docs
- Generates description
- Creates PR via GitHub CLI

**Time:** 10 sec (was 5-10 min manual)  
**Savings:** 95-98% time reduction

## AI Prompting Strategies

### ✅ What Worked

**1. Reference Existing Files**
```
"Following: @templates/PR-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md
Reference: @archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md"
```
AI sees exact format, matches perfectly

**2. Be Explicit**
```
Good: "Implement cursor sync per task.md PR #3. Target: 30 FPS, <50ms latency"
Bad: "Make cursors work"
```

**3. Show Don't Tell**
```
Instead of: "Format like previous PRs"
Do: "Format like @archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md"
```

**4. Document Gotchas Immediately**
```
"Document in GOTCHAS.md:
Issue: [what broke]
Root cause: [why]
Solution: [fix]
Prevention: [avoid]"
```
Fresh memory = complete details

**5. Chunk Complex Tasks**
```
Not: "Build entire auth system"
Do: Session 1: AuthService, Session 2: AuthContext, Session 3: UI
```

### ❌ What Didn't Work

**1. Vague Requirements**
```
"Make canvas better" → AI confused, wastes time
```

**2. Assuming Context Across Sessions**
```
"Continue working on cursors" → Which part? What state?
Fix: Start each session with full context
```

**3. No Error Details**
```
"It's not working" → Can't help
"Error X at line Y: [paste code]" → AI debugs fast
```

**4. Too Much at Once**
```
"Build auth, cursors, and shapes" → Overwhelmed, incomplete
```

---

## Context Windows & Restarts

### The Challenge

Long projects fill AI context (200K tokens). AI forgets earlier decisions.

### The Solution: Documentation as Memory

**Strategy:**
```
When context full:
1. Save state → PR-X-IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md
2. Document decisions → ARCHITECTURE.md or GOTCHAS.md
3. Fresh session
4. Load: "@prd.md @task.md @PR-X-STATUS.md"
```

### Restart Types

**Type 1: Between PRs (Planned)**
```
"Starting PR #4: Shape Creation
Prior PRs #0-3 complete
Follow: @task.md PR #4, @PR-4-TEST-PLAN.md"
```

**Type 2: Mid-Implementation (Context Full)**
```
Before restart: "Update PR-5-STATUS.md with progress"
New session: "Continue PR #5 per @PR-5-STATUS.md"
```

**Type 3: Stuck on Bug**
```
Fresh session: "Bug: [symptom]
Already tried: [list]
Code: @src/hooks/useCursors.ts"
```
Fresh perspective often spots what tired context missed

**Metrics:**
- Restarts per PR: 1-3
- Time per restart: ~5 min (loading context)
- Context loss: Minimal (docs preserved state)

## The PR Automation Story

### How We Built It (3 AI Sessions)

**Session 1: Core Function**
```
"Build bash script to:
- Analyze commits
- Find PR-X-SUMMARY.md
- Extract sections
- Generate PR description
- Create via GitHub CLI"
```
Result: 90% working script

**Session 2: Polish**
```
"Issues: [list bugs]
Fix these"
```
Result: Fully functional

**Session 3: UX**
```
"Add color output, progress indicators, preview"
```
Result: Beautiful terminal UX

**Total Time:** 1.5 hours  
**Time Saved:** 80+ minutes (10 PRs × 8 min each)  
**ROI:** 10x

## Lessons Learned

### Top 5 Wins ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**1. Test Plans Before Code**
- Saved 2-4 hours per PR
- Tests passed first try
- Caught edge cases early

**2. Template-Driven Docs**
- Zero cognitive load
- Consistent quality
- 5 min (was 60 min)

**3. PR Automation**
- 95% time savings
- Never forget sections
- Consistent format

**4. Incremental PRs**
- Always deployable
- Easy to review
- Clear checkpoints

**5. GOTCHAS.md (Living Doc)**
- Saved 3-4 hours total
- Bug hit 3x: 1st=1hr, 2nd=30sec, 3rd=prevented

### Top 4 Mistakes (And Fixes)

**1. Vague Requirements**
- Problem: "Make auth work" → 20 min clarifying
- Fix: Created 35KB prd.md upfront

**2. Delayed Gotcha Docs**
- Problem: Forgot solution, re-debugged 30 min
- Fix: Document IMMEDIATELY after fix

**3. Too Much Per Session**
- Problem: "Do auth + cursors + shapes" → incomplete
- Fix: Chunk into focused sessions

**4. Not Testing Before Moving On**
- Problem: "Compiles" ≠ "Works"
- Fix: AI completes → Test → Fix → Move on

### Unexpected Wins

**AI Debugging is Excellent**
```
Dev: "onSnapshot is not a function"
AI: "You imported from 'firestore/lite' not 'firestore'"
```
Often faster than human debugging

**Templates = Productivity Multiplier**
- Before: 5-10 min thinking "What sections?"
- After: 30 sec prompting AI

**Good Architecture Helps AI**
- Service layer gave AI patterns to follow
- Consistent APIs across features
- Easier for AI to maintain patterns

## The Formula

```
Clear Requirements (prd.md)
  + Test Plans First (AI-generated)
  + Template-Driven Docs (AI-generated)
  + Incremental PRs (10 self-contained)
  + Context Management (status docs)
  + Automation (PR script)
  = Fast, High-Quality Development
```

---

## Key Takeaways

**1. AI Requires Structure**
- Clear requirements document
- Test plans before code
- Templates for consistency
- Context management strategy

**2. Documentation is Investment**
- GOTCHAS.md prevented repeated bugs
- Templates accelerated all PRs
- Architecture docs guided AI

**3. Automation Compounds**
- Small scripts × many uses = huge savings
- 10 sec vs 10 min × 10 PRs = 80+ min saved

**4. Structure Enables Speed**
- Incremental PRs weren't constraint
- They were enabler for:
  - Clear checkpoints
  - Always deployable
  - Easy to resume

**Key Insight:**
> "AI doesn't replace structure, it requires structure.  
> But with structure, AI is a genuine force multiplier."

@templates/PR-TEST-PLAN-TEMPLATE.md
@archive/PR-3-TEST-PLAN.md for format"
```

**Implementation:**
```
"Implement per PR-X-TEST-PLAN.md
Architecture: @architecture.md
Update PR-X-STATUS.md as you work"
```

**Documentation:**
```
"Create summary per @templates/PR-SUMMARY-TEMPLATE.md
Reference: @archive/PR-3-SUMMARY.md"
```

**Debugging:**
```
"Error: [exact message]
Code: [context]
Tried: [what didn't work]"
```
