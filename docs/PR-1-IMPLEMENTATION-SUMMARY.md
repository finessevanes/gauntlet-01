  - Color code mappings
  - Default size specifications
  - Example command patterns

### 3. Creation Tools (4 Total)
Implemented as OpenAI function tools:
1. **createRectangle** - x, y, width, height, color
2. **createCircle** - x, y, radius, color
3. **createTriangle** - x, y, width, height, color
4. **createText** - text, x, y, fontSize, color, fontWeight, fontStyle, textDecoration

### 4. Testing Infrastructure
- **File:** `collabcanvas/AI-SERVICE-TESTING.md`
- **Purpose:** Complete testing guide with 9 test cases
- **Features:**
  - Setup instructions
  - Console test commands
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Success criteria

### 5. Global Exposure for Testing
- **Modified:** `collabcanvas/src/main.tsx`
- **Change:** Exposed `AIService` class via `window.AIService` for easy console testing

## üì¶ Dependencies Installed

```json
{
  "openai": "^6.4.0"
}
```

---

## üîß Configuration Required (User Action)

### Step 1: Create `.env` File
Create `collabcanvas/.env` with:
```bash
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### Step 2: Get OpenAI API Key
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

---

## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (Browser Console)
```javascript
// 1. Start dev server: npm run dev
// 2. Open browser console (F12)
// 3. Run:
const ai = new window.AIService();
await ai.executeCommand("create a blue circle in the center", "test_user");
```

### Full Test Suite
See `collabcanvas/AI-SERVICE-TESTING.md` for all 9 test cases.

## üé® Example Commands

The AI can understand natural language commands like:

```
"create a blue rectangle at 500, 500"
"add a red circle in the center"
"make a green triangle in the bottom-left"
"create bold text saying Hello World at the top"
"add 3 yellow squares"
```

---

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. Natural Language Understanding
- Understands vague positions ("center", "top-left", etc.)
- Interprets color names (blue ‚Üí #3b82f6)
- Applies sensible defaults (200√ó150 for rectangles)

### 2. Canvas State Awareness
- AI receives current canvas state
- Can make decisions based on existing shapes
- Provides context for better command execution

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful API failure recovery
- User-friendly error messages
- Detailed console logging for debugging

### 4. Success Feedback
- Specific messages for each tool ("‚úì Created 1 rectangle")
- Multi-element messages ("‚úì Created 3 elements")
- Partial success reporting ("‚ö†Ô∏è Completed 2 actions, but 1 failed")

---

## üîç Code Quality

### Linter Status: ‚úÖ PASS
- No TypeScript errors
- No ESLint warnings
- Follows existing project patterns

### Type Safety: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- All functions properly typed
- Interfaces defined for CommandResult
- Proper integration with existing CanvasService types

### Integration: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- Uses existing `canvasService` methods
- Compatible with existing shape types
- Maintains consistency with project architecture

---

## üìä Success Criteria Status

### Implementation (All Complete ‚úÖ)
- [x] OpenAI dependency installed
- [x] AIService class implemented
- [x] 4 creation tools defined
- [x] System prompt with position helpers
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Success message generation
- [x] Global exposure for testing

### Testing (Pending User Action ‚è≥)
- [ ] User sets up OpenAI API key
- [ ] User runs 9 test commands
- [ ] User verifies shapes appear on canvas
- [ ] User confirms API response times

---

## üéØ What's Next (PR #2)

After testing is complete, PR #2 will add:
- 11 manipulation tools (move, resize, rotate, delete, etc.)
- Group operations (group, ungroup)
- Alignment commands (align left, distribute, etc.)
- Layout commands ("arrange in a row")
- Expanded system prompt

**Do NOT implement PR #2 features yet.** This PR focuses solely on creation tools.

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **Browser-Only Mode:** Uses `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` (fine for MVP, not recommended for production)
2. **No Rate Limiting:** No built-in rate limiting on API calls
3. **No Token Counting:** No cost tracking or token usage monitoring
4. **Simple Error Messages:** Basic error handling (can be enhanced later)

---

## üìù Notes for User

1. **API Key Security:** Never commit your `.env` file. It's already in `.gitignore`.
2. **OpenAI Costs:** Each command costs ~$0.01-0.02 depending on complexity.
3. **Model Used:** GPT-4 Turbo Preview (`gpt-4-turbo-preview`) for best function calling.
4. **Testing:** All 9 test commands should work once API key is configured.
5. **Global Access:** `window.AIService` is available in browser console for easy testing.

---

## ‚úÖ Ready to Test

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Follow these steps:

1. Set up your OpenAI API key in `.env`
2. Run `npm run dev` in the `collabcanvas` directory
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Follow test commands in `AI-SERVICE-TESTING.md`
5. Verify shapes appear on canvas

**Any issues?** See the troubleshooting section in `AI-SERVICE-TESTING.md`.

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check `AI-SERVICE-TESTING.md` troubleshooting section
2. Verify API key is valid and has credits
3. Check browser console for error messages
4. Verify Firebase is connected and working
