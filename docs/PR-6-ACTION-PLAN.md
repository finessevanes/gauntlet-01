# PR #6: Multi-Select Feature - Implementation Tasks

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE (100% Complete)

Implementation tasks for the Multi-Select feature with batch operations and selection locking based on task.md requirements.

## State Management

### CanvasContext Updates
- [x] Add `selectedShapes` state to CanvasContext: `string[]` (array of shape IDs)
- [x] Add `setSelectedShapes` method to context type
- [x] Export `selectedShapes` and `setSelectedShapes` in context value
- [x] Update context interface to include new state and methods
- [x] Test: Console.log selectedShapes on any click, verify array updates

## Technical Implementation: Atomic Batch Writes

### Why Atomic Batch Writes Are Critical

When moving multiple shapes simultaneously, using individual update operations causes a **staggered update problem**:

**❌ Problem with Promise.all():**
```typescript
// BAD: Each update is a separate network request
const updatePromises = selectedShapes.map(id => 
  updateShape(id, { x: newX, y: newY })
);
await Promise.all(updatePromises);

// Result: Remote users see objects arrive one-by-one with visible delay
// Shape 1 arrives → 50ms → Shape 2 arrives → 50ms → Shape 3 arrives
```

**✅ Solution with Firestore Batch Writes:**
```typescript
// GOOD: Single atomic operation
const batchUpdates = selectedShapes.map(id => ({
  shapeId: id,
  updates: { x: newX, y: newY }
}));
await batchUpdateShapes(batchUpdates);

// Result: All shapes arrive simultaneously in one snapshot update
// All shapes arrive together → instant coordinated movement
```

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Service Layer (canvasService.ts)

```typescript
import { writeBatch } from 'firebase/firestore';

async batchUpdateShapes(
  updates: Array<{ shapeId: string; updates: ShapeUpdateInput }>
): Promise<void> {
  const batch = writeBatch(firestore);
  
  for (const { shapeId, updates: shapeUpdates } of updates) {
    const shapeRef = doc(firestore, this.shapesCollectionPath, shapeId);
    batch.update(shapeRef, {
      ...shapeUpdates,
      updatedAt: serverTimestamp(),
    });
  }
  
  await batch.commit(); // Single atomic operation
}
```

#### 2. Context Layer (CanvasContext.tsx)

```typescript
// Add to context interface
interface CanvasContextType {
  batchUpdateShapes: (updates: Array<{ 
    shapeId: string; 
    updates: Partial<ShapeData> 
  }>) => Promise<void>;
  // ... other methods
}

// Implement in provider
const batchUpdateShapes = async (updates) => {
  return await canvasService.batchUpdateShapes(updates);
};

// Include in context value
const value = {
  batchUpdateShapes,
  // ... other values
};
```

#### 3. Component Layer (Canvas.tsx)

```typescript
const handleShapeDragEnd = async (e, shapeId) => {
  // ... calculate positions ...
  
  if (selectedShapes.length > 1) {
    // Prepare batch updates
    const batchUpdates = [];
    
    for (const id of selectedShapes) {
      const shape = shapes.find(s => s.id === id);
      // ... calculate new position ...
      
      batchUpdates.push({
        shapeId: id,
        updates: { x: clampedX, y: clampedY }
      });
    }
    
    // Send all updates atomically
    await batchUpdateShapes(batchUpdates);
  }
};
```

### Performance Benefits

| Metric | Promise.all() | Batch Writes | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| Network Requests | N requests | 1 request | N-1 fewer |
| Remote Update Latency | N × 50ms | 50ms | ~(N-1) × 50ms |
| Snapshot Events | N events | 1 event | N-1 fewer |
| User Experience | Staggered | Instant | Smooth |

**Example**: Moving 5 shapes
- **Before**: 5 requests × 50ms = 250ms total delay
- **After**: 1 request = 50ms (5× faster)

### Firestore Batch Write Limits

- **Maximum**: 500 operations per batch
- **Cost**: Same as individual writes
- **Atomicity**: All succeed or all fail (transaction-like)
- **Use Case**: Perfect for multi-select operations (typically < 50 shapes)

### Testing Verification

```typescript
// Log to verify atomic updates
console.log(`✅ Batch updated ${updates.length} shapes atomically`);

// Expected behavior:
// 1. Moving user sees immediate movement (optimistic update)
// 2. Remote users receive ONE snapshot update with ALL changes
// 3. All shapes move together with no visible delay
```
