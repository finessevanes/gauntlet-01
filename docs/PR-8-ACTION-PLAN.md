## Implementation Summary

### 1. Service Layer - Alignment & Distribution ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `collabcanvas/src/services/canvasService.ts`

**Methods Added:**

#### `alignShapes(shapeIds: string[], alignment: 'left' | 'center' | 'right' | 'top' | 'middle' | 'bottom'): Promise<void>`
- Aligns 2+ shapes along a common edge or center
- Supports 6 alignment types:
  - **left**: Align all shapes to the leftmost x position
  - **center**: Align all shapes to the average center x position (horizontal)
  - **right**: Align all shapes to the rightmost edge (x + width)
  - **top**: Align all shapes to the topmost y position
  - **middle**: Align all shapes to the average center y position (vertical)
  - **bottom**: Align all shapes to the bottommost edge (y + height)
- Uses batch write for atomic updates
- Validates at least 2 shapes are selected
- Automatically calculates target positions based on alignment type

**Algorithm:**
1. Fetch all shape documents from Firestore
2. Calculate target position based on alignment type (min, max, or average)
3. Update each shape's x or y position to align to target
4. Commit all updates atomically via batch write

#### `distributeShapes(shapeIds: string[], direction: 'horizontal' | 'vertical'): Promise<void>`
- Distributes 3+ shapes evenly along horizontal or vertical axis
- Keeps first and last shapes fixed in position
- Calculates even spacing between middle shapes
- Accounts for shape dimensions (width/height)
- Uses batch write for atomic updates

**Algorithm:**
- **Horizontal**: Sort shapes left-to-right, calculate total space minus all widths, divide remaining space evenly
- **Vertical**: Sort shapes top-to-bottom, calculate total space minus all heights, divide remaining space evenly

**Implementation Details:**
- Both methods validate minimum shape count (2 for align, 3 for distribute)
- Both methods use batch writes to prevent race conditions
- Real-time sync happens automatically via Firestore listeners
- Error handling with console logging for debugging

### 2. Context Layer - Expose Alignment Methods ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `collabcanvas/src/contexts/CanvasContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Added `alignShapes()` method to CanvasContextType interface
- Added `distributeShapes()` method to CanvasContextType interface
- Implemented wrapper functions that call `canvasService.alignShapes()` and `canvasService.distributeShapes()`
- Exposed methods in context value for consumption by components

**Integration:**
- Methods follow the same pattern as existing operations (grouping, z-index)
- Error handling deferred to service layer
- Context simply passes through to service methods

---

### 3. UI Component - AlignmentToolbar ✅

**Files Created:**
- `collabcanvas/src/components/Canvas/AlignmentToolbar.tsx`

**Features:**
- Shows toolbar only when 2+ shapes are selected
- Displays 8 buttons in 2 rows:
  - **Row 1**: Left, Center, Right | Top, Middle, Bottom (6 alignment buttons)
  - **Row 2**: Distribute Horizontally, Distribute Vertically (2 distribution buttons)
- Each button has:
  - Icon (SVG) showing visual representation of alignment
  - Label text for clarity
  - Tooltip with description
- Distribution buttons disabled when < 3 shapes selected
- Info text showing selection count and distribution requirements
- Modern styling consistent with existing ToolPalette
- Fixed positioning at top-center of canvas
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling

**Button Icons:**
- Custom SVG icons for each alignment type
- Visual representation helps users understand what each alignment does
- Icons show example shapes with alignment guides (lines)

**User Experience:**
- Toolbar appears automatically when 2+ shapes selected
- Clear visual feedback for which buttons are enabled/disabled
- Tooltips provide additional context on hover
- Info text explains requirements (e.g., "3+ needed for distribution")

### 4. Canvas Integration ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `collabcanvas/src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Imported `AlignmentToolbar` component
- Added toolbar to component tree (renders after TextInput overlay)
- Passed `selectedShapes` prop to toolbar
- Toolbar automatically shows/hides based on selection count

**Positioning:**
- Toolbar uses fixed positioning (`fixed top-20 left-1/2 transform -translate-x-1/2`)
- Positioned at top-center of viewport
- High z-index (`z-50`) to appear above canvas but below modals
- Independent of stage zoom/pan (fixed to viewport)

---

## Integration Points

### Firestore
- Alignment operations update shape documents in `canvases/main/shapes` collection
- Uses batch writes for atomic updates
- Real-time listeners automatically sync changes to all users

### Selection Service
- Relies on existing `selectedShapes` state from CanvasContext
- No changes needed to selection service

### Canvas Context
- Exposes alignment methods alongside existing shape operations
- Consistent API with grouping and z-index operations

### UI Components
- AlignmentToolbar follows same styling patterns as ToolPalette
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes consistent with project

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Alignment Operations (2+ shapes required)
- [ ] **Align Left**: Select 3 rectangles with different x positions → click Align Left → all align to leftmost edge
- [ ] **Align Center**: Select 3 shapes → click Align Center → all center horizontally (vertical line through centers)
- [ ] **Align Right**: Select 3 shapes → click Align Right → all align to rightmost edge
- [ ] **Align Top**: Select 3 shapes → click Align Top → all align to topmost edge
- [ ] **Align Middle**: Select 3 shapes → click Align Middle → all center vertically (horizontal line through centers)
- [ ] **Align Bottom**: Select 3 shapes → click Align Bottom → all align to bottommost edge

#### Distribution Operations (3+ shapes required)
- [ ] **Distribute Horizontally**: Select 5 shapes with uneven spacing → click Distribute H → equal gaps between all shapes
- [ ] **Distribute Vertically**: Select 5 shapes with uneven spacing → click Distribute V → equal gaps between all shapes
- [ ] **Distribution with 2 shapes**: Verify button is disabled and shows tooltip explaining 3+ required

#### Multi-Shape Type Testing
- [ ] Test alignments with mixed shape types (rectangles, circles, triangles, text)
- [ ] Test distribution with different sized shapes (small + large)
- [ ] Verify circles align properly (using their bounding box)
- [ ] Verify text layers align properly

#### Real-Time Collaboration
- [ ] **User A** aligns 3 shapes left → **User B** sees alignment in <100ms
- [ ] **User A** distributes shapes horizontally → **User B** sees distribution in <100ms
- [ ] Test with multiple users selecting/aligning simultaneously

#### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Toolbar appears when 2+ shapes selected
- [ ] Toolbar disappears when < 2 shapes selected
- [ ] Distribution buttons disabled when < 3 shapes selected
- [ ] Tooltips show on hover for all buttons
- [ ] Info text updates to show selection count
- [ ] No console errors during any operations

#### Edge Cases
- [ ] Select shapes on opposite sides of canvas → verify alignment works
- [ ] Align grouped shapes (should work like normal shapes)
- [ ] Align shapes with different z-indexes
- [ ] Distribute shapes that are already evenly spaced (should still work)
- [ ] Test with minimum sized shapes
- [ ] Test with maximum sized shapes

### Console Testing

You can also test the service methods directly from the browser console:

```javascript
// Get the canvas service
const { canvasService } = await import('/src/services/canvasService.ts');

// Test align left with 3 shape IDs
await canvasService.alignShapes(['shape-id-1', 'shape-id-2', 'shape-id-3'], 'left');

// Test distribute horizontally with 4 shape IDs
await canvasService.distributeShapes(['shape-id-1', 'shape-id-2', 'shape-id-3', 'shape-id-4'], 'horizontal');
```

## Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Alignment Calculation**:
   - For edge alignments (left, right, top, bottom), we use min/max to find the target edge
   - For center alignments (center, middle), we calculate the average center position
   - This ensures intuitive behavior: shapes align to the extremes or cluster around center

2. **Distribution Algorithm**:
   - First and last shapes stay fixed (preserves overall bounds)
   - Middle shapes are repositioned with equal spacing
   - Spacing accounts for shape dimensions (not just centers)
   - Requires 3+ shapes because 2 shapes don't need distribution

3. **Batch Operations**:
   - All shape updates use batch writes for atomicity
   - Prevents partial updates if one shape fails
   - Ensures all users see changes simultaneously

4. **Toolbar Positioning**:
   - Fixed to viewport (not canvas) for consistent accessibility
   - Top-center position doesn't interfere with ToolPalette (left side)
   - High z-index ensures visibility above canvas elements

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Service layer validates shape count requirements
   - UI layer disables buttons when requirements not met
   - Console logging for debugging
   - Toast notifications could be added for user feedback

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future PRs:
- Keyboard shortcuts for alignment (Cmd+Shift+L for left, etc.)
- Align to canvas center/edges (not just to other shapes)
- Smart guides showing alignment as you drag shapes
- Align to grid/snap points
- Distribute with custom spacing values
- Align text baselines (for text layers)
- Align to selection bounds (bounding box of all selected shapes)
