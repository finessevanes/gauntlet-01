## Bug Fixes Applied ✅ COMPLETED

### Issue 1: Text Overlay Duplication
- [x] **Problem**: HTML overlay appeared on top of Konva text, causing visual duplication
- [x] **Solution**: Hide Konva text when `editingTextId` matches the shape ID
- [x] **Files Modified**: `CanvasShape.tsx`, `Canvas.tsx`
- [x] **Result**: Clean editing experience with no visual overlap

### Issue 2: Cursor State After Editing
- [x] **Problem**: Cursor remained in text tool after completing text editing
- [x] **Solution**: Reset cursor to 'select' tool in `saveText()` and `cancelEdit()` functions
- [x] **Files Modified**: `CanvasContext.tsx`
- [x] **Result**: Cursor automatically returns to pointer after text editing
