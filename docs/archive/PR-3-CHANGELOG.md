# PR #3: Cursor Sync + Presence - Changelog

## Changes Made - October 14, 2025

## ✅ Enhancement: Canvas Bounds Enforcement

### Issue Identified
During review, it was discovered that cursors were visible anywhere on the Stage/viewport, including the gray background area outside the 5000×5000 white canvas rectangle.

### Decision
**Implemented canvas bounds checking** to ensure cursors only appear within the defined work area (5000×5000 white canvas).

### Rationale
1. **Better UX:** Cursors only where actual work happens
2. **Clear mental model:** White rectangle = collaborative space
3. **Industry standard:** Matches behavior of Figma, Miro, etc.
4. **Less visual noise:** No floating cursors in gray void

---

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes

**File:** `/src/hooks/useCursors.ts`

**Added bounds checking after coordinate transformation:**
```typescript
// Check if cursor is within canvas bounds (5000×5000)
if (
  canvasPos.x < 0 || 
  canvasPos.x > CANVAS_WIDTH || 
  canvasPos.y < 0 || 
  canvasPos.y > CANVAS_HEIGHT
) {
  // Outside canvas bounds - remove cursor
  cursorService.removeCursor(user.uid);
  return;
}

// Inside canvas bounds - update cursor position
throttledUpdateRef.current(canvasPos.x, canvasPos.y);
```

**Imports updated:**
```typescript
import { CURSOR_UPDATE_INTERVAL, CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT } from '../utils/constants';
```

## Testing Impact

### New Test Requirements

**Before (Original):**
- Cursor appears when mouse enters canvas
- Cursor disappears when mouse leaves canvas

**After (Enhanced):**
- Cursor appears when mouse enters **5000×5000 white area**
- Cursor disappears when mouse moves to **gray background**
- Cursor reappears when returning to white area
- Cursors **NEVER** visible in gray background
- Verification at different zoom levels

---

## Behavior Changes

### What Changed

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Mouse in white canvas | ✅ Cursor visible | ✅ Cursor visible |
| Mouse in gray background | ✅ Cursor visible | ❌ Cursor NOT visible |
| Mouse off browser | ❌ Cursor NOT visible | ❌ Cursor NOT visible |

### User Experience

**Before:**
- Cursors could appear floating in gray area
- Unclear where "canvas" ends
- Visual clutter when panning

**After:**
- Cursors only in defined work area (white rectangle)
- Clear boundary for collaborative space
- Cleaner, more professional appearance

---

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead

**Additional computation per cursor update:**
- 4 simple comparisons (x/y min/max)
- Early return if outside bounds (saves network call!)
- No noticeable performance impact

**Benefits:**
- Fewer RTDB writes when mouse outside bounds
- Slightly better network efficiency

---

## Breaking Changes

### None

This is a **non-breaking enhancement:**
- Existing functionality preserved
- Only affects cursor visibility behavior
- No API changes
- No data structure changes
- Backward compatible

---

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

No migration needed. This change is transparent to:
- Service layer (cursorService)
- Database structure (RTDB paths unchanged)
- Other components (PresenceList, etc.)

### For Users

No action required. Enhanced behavior takes effect immediately.

---

## Related Issues

- **User Feedback:** "Cursors appearing in gray area is confusing"
- **UX Improvement:** Clearer work area definition
- **Consistency:** Matches industry standards (Figma, Miro)

---

## Testing Verification

### Manual Testing Required

1. ✅ Two users connected
2. ✅ Move cursor in white canvas → visible
3. ✅ Move cursor to gray area → disappears
4. ✅ Move cursor back to white → reappears
5. ✅ Test at various zoom levels
6. ✅ Test while panning

### Expected Results

All tests pass with new bounds enforcement.
