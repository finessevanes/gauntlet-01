## 🎯 Feature Validation

### Authentication Flow ✅
- Signup creates user with cursor color
- Login fetches user profile
- Logout cleans up presence
- Session persists across refresh
- Error messages are user-friendly

### Cursor & Presence Sync ✅
- Cursors update at 20-30 FPS
- Only visible within canvas bounds
- Multi-user tracking works
- Presence list updates on join/leave
- Auto-cleanup on disconnect

### Shape Creation & Sync ✅
- Click-and-drag rectangle creation
- Negative drags handled correctly
- Tiny drags (<10px) ignored
- Preview shows while dragging
- Shapes sync <100ms
- Shapes persist across refresh

### Shape Locking ✅
- First-click lock acquisition
- Lock timeout after 5 seconds
- Green border when locked by me
- Red border + lock icon when locked by other
- Lock releases on deselect/drag-end/disconnect
- Error notification on lock failure

### Performance ✅
- Cursor sync: 30.3 FPS (target: 20-30 FPS)
- Shape sync: <100ms latency
- Lock timeout: 5000ms
- Multi-user: 5+ concurrent users
- Shape capacity: 500+ shapes

## 🛡️ Security Rules

### Firestore Rules ✅
```javascript
// Users: Can only write own document
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Shapes: Validate createdBy on create
match /canvases/main/shapes/{shapeId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                   request.resource.data.createdBy == request.auth.uid;
  allow update: if request.auth != null;
  allow delete: if request.auth != null;
}
```

### RTDB Rules ✅
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "sessions": {
      "main": {
        "users": {
          "$userId": {
            ".read": "auth != null",
            ".write": "auth != null && auth.uid == $userId"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
