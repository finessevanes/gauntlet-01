## When to Reference vs When to Update

### Reference (Read-Only)
- Understanding past decisions
- Learning from examples
- Debugging similar issues
- Writing new PR docs

### Update (Write)
- **Never!** This is historical documentation
- For current issues, update `/collabcanvas/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` or `/collabcanvas/GOTCHAS.md`
- For new features, create fresh PR docs in `/collabcanvas/` (consolidate later)

---

## Related Documentation

- **Core Docs:** `/collabcanvas/README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `GOTCHAS.md`
- **Templates:** `/docs/templates/` (blank, annotated, example versions)
- **AI Prompts:** `/docs/templates/AI-PROMPTS.md`
- **Documentation Guide:** `/collabcanvas/DOCS-GUIDE.md`

grep -r "cursor" docs/archive/

# Search for error messages
grep -r "Error" docs/archive/*.md

# Find performance metrics
grep -r "FPS\|latency\|performance" docs/archive/PR-*-SUMMARY.md
```

## Feedback & Iteration

This archive represents the **evolved** documentation pattern. Earlier PRs (0-2) have less detail, later PRs (3-7) have more structure.

**The pattern improved as we learned what was useful.**

When adapting this pattern for your project, expect similar evolution. Start simple, add sections that prove valuable, remove sections that don't get used.
