# PR #2 vs PR #3 - Feature Breakdown

## ✅ PR #2: Canvas Shell + Pan/Zoom + Color Toolbar (CURRENT)

### What You CAN Do Right Now:
- ✅ Login with your account
- ✅ See the 5000×5000 canvas with grid
- ✅ **Pan** by clicking and dragging the canvas
- ✅ **Zoom** with mouse wheel (cursor-centered)
- ✅ **Select colors** from the toolbar (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow)
- ✅ See canvas info (zoom %, position) in bottom-left
- ✅ Open multiple browser windows (each sees their own view)

### What You CANNOT Do Yet:
- ❌ See other users' cursors moving
- ❌ See other users in a presence list
- ❌ Create shapes by drawing
- ❌ Real-time collaboration

### Testing PR #2:
Open 2 browser windows and you'll see:
- Both can pan/zoom independently
- Both can select colors
- **NO cursor tracking between windows** (that's next!)

---

## ⏳ PR #3: Cursor Sync + Presence (NEXT)

### What Will Be Added:
- ✅ Real-time cursor tracking (20-30 FPS)
- ✅ See other users' cursors with name labels
- ✅ Each cursor has unique color
- ✅ Presence list showing who's online
- ✅ Firebase Realtime Database integration
- ✅ Auto-cleanup when users disconnect

### How It Will Work:
1. Your mouse moves on canvas
2. Position sent to Firebase RTDB (throttled to 33ms)
3. Other users see your cursor update in real-time
4. Cursors disappear when users leave

## 🎯 Current Issue: "I can't see someone else's cursor"

**This is EXPECTED!** 

Cursor tracking is PR #3, not PR #2. Right now each browser window is independent.

### What's Working (PR #2):
- Canvas renders ✅
- Pan/zoom works ✅
- Colors switch ✅
- No errors (after fix) ✅

### What's Coming (PR #3):
- Cursor sync 🔜
- Presence awareness 🔜
- Multi-user collaboration 🔜

- [ ] Does zoom center on your cursor?
- [ ] Do color buttons switch when clicked?
- [ ] Is blue selected by default?

## Development Order (per PRD)

```
PR #0: Firebase Setup           ✅ DONE
PR #1: Authentication            ✅ DONE
PR #2: Canvas Core (You are here) ✅ DONE
PR #3: Cursors + Presence        ⏳ NEXT
PR #4: Shape Creation            📋 PLANNED
PR #5: Locking + Drag            📋 PLANNED
PR #6: Testing + Polish          📋 PLANNED
PR #7: Deployment                📋 PLANNED
```

---

## Why This Order?

1. **Auth First** - Need users before tracking anything
2. **Canvas Second** - Need workspace before interactions
3. **Cursors Third** - Validate real-time sync before adding complexity
4. **Shapes Fourth** - Add collaborative objects
5. **Locking Fifth** - Prevent conflicts

This ensures each layer works before building the next!
