# PR #5: Shape Locking + Drag - Implementation Status

**Last Updated:** October 14, 2025, 2:30 PM  
**Status:** 🚧 In Progress

---

## ✅ Completed

- [x] Enhanced `canvasService.lockShape()` with timeout check
  - File: `src/services/canvasService.ts`
  - Details: Now checks if lock is <5s old, returns success/failure with username

- [x] Added lock visual indicators
  - File: `src/components/Canvas/Canvas.tsx`
  - Details: Green border (locked by me), red border + lock icon (locked by other)

- [x] Integrated `react-hot-toast` for notifications
  - File: `src/App.tsx`
  - Details: Shows "Shape locked by [username]" on failed lock attempt

---

## 🚧 In Progress

- [ ] Implementing drag-to-move functionality
  - Started: 2:00 PM
  - Details: Adding `handleShapeDragEnd` to update position in Firestore
  - Blockers: None

---

## 📋 To Do

- [ ] Add 5-second auto-unlock timeout
- [ ] Test multi-user lock scenarios
- [ ] Create PR summary and quick-start docs

---

## ❓ Blocked / Questions

**Question 1:**
- **Question:** Should lock auto-release on drag end or after timeout?
- **Context:** PRD mentions both behaviors
- **Decision:** Release on drag end AND 5s timeout (more forgiving UX)

---

## 💡 Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Non-Transactional Lock (MVP)
- **Date:** October 14, 10 AM
- **Decision:** Use simple Firestore update, not transactions
- **Rationale:** MVP speed priority, race conditions rare with 2-5 users (<50ms window)
- **Alternatives:** Firestore transactions (more robust, +2 hours implementation)
- **Post-MVP:** Can upgrade to transactions if needed

### Decision 2: Client-Side + Server-Side Timeout
- **Date:** October 14, 1 PM  
- **Decision:** Check lock age both in UI and in lockShape() method
- **Rationale:** UI check for responsiveness, server check for security
- **Trade-off:** Slight code duplication but better UX

---

## 🐛 Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: Lock icon not showing
- **When:** October 14, 11 AM
- **Symptom:** Red border appeared but no 🔒 emoji
- **Fix:** Added `<Text>` component in Konva for emoji rendering
- **Documented:** [x] Added to GOTCHAS.md

## 📊 Progress

**Estimated Completion:** October 14, 5 PM
