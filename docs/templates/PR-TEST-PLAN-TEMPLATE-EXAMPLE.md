## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Tests

- [x] **Test 1:** Single user cursor tracking
  - **Steps:** 
    1. Sign in as User A
    2. Move mouse around canvas
    3. Observe cursor updates
  - **Expected:** Cursor position tracked smoothly, no lag
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Smooth tracking at 30 FPS

- [x] **Test 2:** Two users see each other's cursors
  - **Steps:**
    1. Browser 1: Sign in as "Alice"
    2. Browser 2: Sign in as "Bob"
    3. Move cursors in both browsers
  - **Expected:** Each user sees other's cursor with username label
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Both cursors visible, colors different

- [x] **Test 3:** Presence list shows online users
  - **Steps:**
    1. Browser 1: Sign in as "Alice"
    2. Verify presence list shows "1 online"
    3. Browser 2: Sign in as "Bob"
    4. Check presence list in Browser 1
  - **Expected:** Presence list updates to show both users
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Updates within 100ms

### Edge Case Tests

- [x] **Test 4:** Cursor disappears when leaving canvas
  - **Setup:** Two browsers with users logged in
  - **Steps:**
    1. User A moves cursor outside canvas (into gray area)
    2. User B observes
  - **Expected:** User A's cursor disappears from User B's view
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Cursor only visible within 5000×5000 bounds

- [x] **Test 5:** Cursor tracking with pan/zoom
  - **Setup:** Canvas panned and zoomed
  - **Steps:**
    1. Pan canvas 500px right, 300px down
    2. Zoom to 150%
    3. Move cursor in Browser 1
    4. Observe in Browser 2
  - **Expected:** Cursor appears at correct position regardless of viewport
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Coordinate transformation works correctly

- [x] **Test 6:** Rapid cursor movement (stress test)
  - **Steps:**
    1. Move cursor rapidly across entire canvas
    2. Observe in second browser
  - **Expected:** Smooth tracking, no jank or dropped frames
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Throttling to 30 FPS prevents overwhelming RTDB

### Multi-User Tests

- [x] **Test 7:** 3 users simultaneously
  - **Setup:** 
    - Browser 1 (Incognito): Alice
    - Browser 2 (Normal): Bob
    - Browser 3 (Firefox): Carol
  - **Steps:**
    1. All 3 users sign in
    2. Move cursors simultaneously
    3. Check presence list in each browser
  - **Expected:** All users see all 3 cursors and presence list shows 3 online
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - All cursors tracked, different colors

- [x] **Test 8:** User disconnect and reconnect
  - **Setup:** 2 users online
  - **Steps:**
    1. **User A:** Close browser
    2. **User B:** Wait 5 seconds, check presence list
    3. **User A:** Reopen browser, sign in
    4. **User B:** Verify presence updates
  - **Expected:** User A goes offline in ~5s, returns when reconnected
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - onDisconnect cleanup works

### Performance Tests

- [x] **Test 9:** Cursor update latency
  - **Target:** <50ms from movement to display in other browser
  - **How to measure:** Visual observation with stopwatch overlay
  - **Steps:**
    1. Set up 2 browsers side-by-side
    2. Move cursor in Browser 1
    3. Observe lag in Browser 2
  - **Expected:** <50ms latency (RTDB target)
  - **Actual:** 30-40ms average
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Exceeds target

- [x] **Test 10:** Canvas FPS with 5 users
  - **Target:** 60 FPS maintained
  - **How to measure:** Browser DevTools Performance monitor
  - **Steps:**
    1. Open 5 browsers with 5 different users
    2. All users move cursors simultaneously
    3. Monitor FPS in DevTools
  - **Expected:** 60 FPS maintained
  - **Actual:** 58-60 FPS
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass

- [x] **Test 11:** RTDB write frequency
  - **Target:** 20-30 FPS (33-50ms between writes)
  - **How to measure:** Firebase Emulator UI logs
  - **Steps:**
    1. Move cursor continuously
    2. Check RTDB write frequency in Emulator UI
  - **Expected:** ~30 writes/second (throttled)
  - **Actual:** 28-32 writes/second
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Throttling working correctly

### Error Handling Tests

- [x] **Test 12:** RTDB connection lost
  - **Setup:** Simulate network interruption
  - **Steps:**
    1. Disconnect network mid-session
    2. Attempt to move cursor
    3. Reconnect network
  - **Expected:** Graceful degradation, recovery on reconnect
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Local cursor still works, remote cursors freeze, resume on reconnect

- [x] **Test 13:** User not authenticated
  - **Setup:** Logged out state
  - **Steps:**
    1. Log out
    2. Attempt to access canvas
  - **Expected:** Redirect to login or show auth prompt
  - **Result:** ✅ Pass - Redirects to login

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] All happy path tests pass
- [x] All edge cases handled gracefully
- [x] Multi-user scenarios work without conflicts
- [x] Performance targets met (<50ms latency, 60 FPS, 30 FPS updates)
- [x] Errors display user-friendly messages
- [x] No console errors
- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Code follows existing service layer pattern

## Test Results Summary

**Total Tests:** 13  
**Passed:** 13 ✅  
**Failed:** 0 ❌  
**Blocked:** 0 ⏸️  

**Overall Status:** ✅ All Pass

## Issues Found

### Issue 1: None - All tests passed on first try

---

## Notes

- **Coordinate transformation** was the most complex part - required understanding Konva's transform matrix
- **RTDB onDisconnect** works flawlessly - no manual cleanup needed
- **Throttling to 30 FPS** feels smooth enough; no need for higher rate
- **Canvas bounds enforcement** prevents cursor confusion (cursors only in white area)
- **Performance excellent** even with 5 concurrent users
- **Different cursor colors** make multi-user collaboration intuitive
- **RTDB latency** (~30-40ms) significantly better than Firestore would be (~200ms)

**Recommendation:** ✅ Ready to merge
